		<description><![CDATA[Hi Anne, Please let me know if you get this reply in your email.  I&#039;m assuming it will send it to you, but haven&#039;t tried it yet :)   
Yes, this is Wordpress.. ( I added a link at the bottom of the theme so it&#039;s more apparent.).  I haven&#039;t seen a whole lot about typepad to wordpress imports, but then again, I haven&#039;t really looked :)  A quick google search came up with a bunch of hits, so it looks pretty possible.  

As for our transition - the blogger to wordpress was pretty simple.  There is a built-in wordpress importer that can bring over your posts, comments, permalinks etc from blogger or typepad (and a bunch of other services).   It didn&#039;t import my images, which is annoying because Blogger will only allow me to link to them for a short time.  There are some plugins that move them over to my host, but they&#039;re really old and don&#039;t work.  Hopefully someone will write a new one soon.  The setting up part was a bit more involved, mainly because of the photo hosting.  There isn&#039;t an amazing built in photo upload/hosting solution in wordpress.  It has a media manager but it&#039;s a bit wonky.  That said, wordpress is great because of all the plugins and addons you can put in it to do whatever you want it to.  So adding in a few plugins and other photo hosting database thingies made it happen ok.  I&#039;m still not perfectly pleased with the way we have the photo stuff setup, but it&#039;s a good start.  More plugins will be written, or I&#039;ll find something else, and all will be well. Hopefully.   

You should look into Moveable Type too.  I think it&#039;s more closely related to typepad and it&#039;s supposed to be a little more user friendly start and go.  Less plugins etc as it&#039;s not a freeware/opensource kinda thing, but supposed to be very cool too.  

That&#039;s my two sense.  I&#039;m enjoying wordpress and it is nice to be able to have static pages (like for your site and our photo pages).  
Good luck,
Thanks for the Congrats.. we&#039;re pretty excited :)
