		<description><![CDATA[Just one week and we leave for Denver to stay in Kathi and Rand&#039;s new townhouse.  They have it furnished and curtains up and a refrig so we can eat in on their new dishes. Just like starting housekeeping all over again for them. They will be going back there from Davis in late June. Hope all is well with you two and time is getting close to your arrival home. 
Love, Grandma and Grandpa J.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&#039;#comment-1971&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Bill and Willa&lt;/a&gt; - We&#039;re doing fine! Just cold here now... mid 40s and 50s with no heat anywhere!  Tea and scarves help though and moving around working on the farm.  Glad to hear spring is on the way to you.  Can&#039;t wait for the warm weather in Hong Kong and Vietnam.  

On another note, we just found out two days ago that Kate was accepted into her top two choices for Graduate schools!!  Chicago and San Francisco.  today we heard she got into another program in Chicago!  She&#039;s 3 for 3 so far with 3 more programs to reply.  Prety exciting!!  We&#039;ll see where we end up but either way we&#039;ll be close to you or close to aunt Kathi - both of which would be good!  

Love, Chad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great pictures and thanks for the update from China. We had been wondering how you were. 
All&#039;s well in Galesburg and the grass is getting green and most all of the snow is gone.
