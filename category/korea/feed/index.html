				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the next few days/weeks we&#8217;ll be posting pictures and stories from our Winter 2010 Vacation.  This is the first installment about the first stop on our adventure &#8211; Seoul.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kate&#8217;s sister, Molly, came to visit us in Korea in late December.  She stayed for about 10 days and we had a great time with her.  It was wonderful to actually get to share this place with someone from home.  The last 4 days that she was here we were off work and we all went to Seoul.  The trip was mainly a whirlwind tour of the city&#8217;s hot spots.  Here are some pictures from Seoul.   There are more in the <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/2010-winter-vacation/seoul-w-molly/" target="_self">gallery</a> to the left.  As always &#8211; click for a larger image.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 04:23 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4321158587_2a705e0839_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4321158587_2a705e0839_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 04:23 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We stopped at a KimBap Restaurant (Korean Fast Food) for a cheap snack before heading off for the afternoon.  This is Ram-bokki a combination of Ramen Noodles and Dakbokki &#8211; spicy sauce and rice cake.  In the background you can see Kim Bap (Korean sushi rolls without the sushi) and Mandu (Korean Dumplings).  Molly had a pretty good amount of Korean food while she was here&#8230; its definitely an experience.  Kate and I love this stuff now <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 06:59 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321897390_ee553bf6c3_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321897390_ee553bf6c3_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 06:59 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There was an Andy Warhol Portraits exhibit at the Seoul Museum of Art, so naturally we checked it out.  It was a coooold night but we ventured out.  The exhibit was fantastic!  A really wide range of his work and a lot of historical information and artifacts about his life.  The English translations of the commentary were also really entertaining.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 07:26 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321891652_51bde48af1_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321891652_51bde48af1_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 07:26 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We got a little lost walking back to the subway which wasn&#8217;t good because it was about 1 degree outside&#8230;but we made it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 01:59 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2770/4321163887_0b2eae35b0_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2770/4321163887_0b2eae35b0_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 01:59 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The next day we went to Bongeun-sa Temple near the Coex Mall.  Every Thursday they have a &#8220;Temple Life&#8221; program where foreigners can get a tour of the temple, learn some basic meditation practices, participate in the Tea Ceremony and make lotus flowers.  It was about 2 hours and a really great way to experience Korean Buddhism up close.  We had hoped to do an overnight Temple Stay the weekend before, but Kate was sick and it didn&#8217;t seem like a good idea.  This was a nice way to still get at least some of the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 02:27 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4321891908_40c23c2593_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4321891908_40c23c2593_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 02:27 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lanterns are hung at the temples for a period of time before and after the four major Buddhist holidays.  I think these were up for the New Year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 02:53 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4321165221_bf21669af9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4321165221_bf21669af9_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 02:53 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is one of the tallest Buddha Statues in Korea.  The picture doesn&#8217;t really do it justice but it was huge!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 03:15 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4321895700_52a792c9d8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4321895700_52a792c9d8_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 03:15 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tea ceremony!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 04:26 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4321159683_7bed68f978_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4321159683_7bed68f978_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 04:26 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kate and Molly making Lotus Flowers</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 04:41 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4321896744_64b71dc95f_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4321896744_64b71dc95f_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 04:41 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Temple is right in the middle of the city &#8211; providing an interesting contrast between the skyscrapers and apartment buildings all around it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 05:28 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4321891216_18126ef8a0_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4321891216_18126ef8a0_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 05:28 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kate and Molly on the Subway.  Seoul has one of the best subways I&#8217;ve ever been on.  It&#8217;s quiet, clean, and fast&#8230; amazing!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 8, 2010 05:53 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4321892310_59bd310b82_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4321892310_59bd310b82_m.jpg" alt="January 8, 2010 05:53 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The last day we took a bus tour around the city.  This was the easiest and cheapest way to see all the highlights of the city.  It was a fun way to spend the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 8, 2010 06:11 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4321892132_6b16cf03db_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4321892132_6b16cf03db_m.jpg" alt="January 8, 2010 06:11 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think this is Namdaemoon, or Dongdaemoon &#8230;  From the bus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also went to see Avatar in 3D one afternoon, and ate some Mexican food in Itaewon.  On Saturday we took Molly to the airport for her early morning flight, then we waited there for our 9:30pm flight.  Stuck in the airport for 13 hours&#8230; not too fun.  Incheon is kind of the most amazing airport in the world though, so it was not a problem&#8230; more on that in the next post&#8230; Manila!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; ">We had school pictures a couple of months ago and our teachers all took these two pictures together.  We also took individual photos, which we never saw, but we were given these a few days later &#8211; just getting around to posting them now, sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The first is a standard posed picture &#8211; (from the roof of the school) with all of the Geundeok teachers and staff.  This is everybody <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[singlepic id=2229 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: left;">The second picture is a new-age-awesomeness picture envisioned by the artiste photographers&#8230; If we were a band, we would be awesome&#8230; but we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re elementary school teachers &#8211; so it&#8217;s just goofy.  But that&#8217;s Korea!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">[singlepic id=2230 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of these people are really amazing.  We&#8217;ve become great friends with a number of them and will miss them greatly when leave in a few months.  One advantage of being at such a small school is that it&#8217;s really like an extended family.  I know every one of these people pretty well and some of them are really our best friends in Korea.  That&#8217;s much less possible at a school with 80 teachers that is departmentalized and divided.   I&#8217;d list the names and positions of everyone in the picture but it would probably be silly.  Our closest friends are the woman on the far left (black sweater tan skirt) &#8211; She&#8217;s the 5th grade teacher, teacher Kim Young-mi and is a year older than us.  She came this year from Taebaek and has been a great friend!  Can&#8217;t imagine the past year without her great sense of humor and fantastic English.  The woman in the front with the White Jacket (younger woman) is our official Co-teacher, Son Eun-Jin.  She&#8217;s amazing!  Such a fantastic friend and always willing to help us when we have problems.  (And she&#8217;s the hardest working person in our school <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) In front of Kate (to the left a bit) in all black is Teacher Kim Suk-jin.  She was our first friend here in Korea and really helped us a lot our first semester here.  She was in the U.S. last summer studying English and is now teaching most of our classes with us (long story).  She&#8217;s great and we will miss her a lot.  Hopefully some of these ladies will come to our wedding!!  There are a number of other teachers I&#8217;d love to tell you about and surely will sometime soon, but for now that&#8217;s it <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Just wanted post these pictures while I was thinking of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the best&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kate and I are enjoying homemade apple pie and whip cream tonight.  Thanks KATE!</p>

<p>Recently our school went on a double field trip day with some of our Garden school funding.</p>
<blockquote><p>NOTE: Our school was designated a &#8220;Garden School&#8221; earlier this year and given some huge amount of money to renovate and redesign the programming.  Kate and I have no idea really why our school was given this &#8220;honor&#8221; but we can assume it has something to do with our Vice Principal who last year was a supervisor at the office of education, so he has lots of connections.  This all doesn&#8217;t really affect us toooo much except that everyone is going crazy trying to figure out how to spend all the money and we&#8217;re cramming in a bunch of field trips before the end of the school year to use some of it up.  Hence.. the double field trip day.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 4-6 graders went to Seoul for 2 days to visit another Garden school and to see some museums etc.  The 1st-3rd graders went to <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/62/">Gyeungju</a>.  This city is about 3 hours south of Samcheok and used to be one of the dynasty capitals before the country was unified and Seoul became the capital.  We&#8217;re talking 600-1000 years ago&#8230;  So we toured some of the major historic sites, a museum, and a famous Buddhist temple.  I&#8217;m glad we got to go on this trip even though the 1st-3rd graders are more difficult to handle than the older kids.  We&#8217;ve seen Seoul so many times, it was nice to check off another place (even if our trip was very fast and not at all comprehensive <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ).</p>
<p>Here are some of our pictures from the trip.  If you&#8217;d like to see the full gallery check it out in the photo pages or click <a title="Gyeungju" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/gyungju-field-trip/">here</a>.</p>
<p>*A note to the reader, Chad did the grunt work for this and I am filling in the captions.  Now you know why Chad suddenly became much more effeminate.  It&#8217;s just me!    -K</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2174 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>The sunrise on our way to see the old city.  We have to leave at 7!</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2177 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Approaching the tombs.  They are from the Silla dynasty (they think).  They were enormous and I think they are one of Korea 1 billion wonders.  I think we saw about 10 that day.  They are scattered all over the place which was very striking when we were driving up.  Did we mention the cold?  It was cold.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2181 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2182 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2186 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one of the fist astronomical observatories in Korea!  It&#8217;s next to the tombs.  We stopped there long enough for each class to get a picture then we moved on.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2187 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2189 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2194 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Next we visited the old royal palace.  If my memory serves me well I&#8217;d say it burned down a few hundred years ago and the building are abotu 20 years old (replicas).  There was a time lapse.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2197 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2202 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2205 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Now we are visiting a temple.  I have to say, the Korean temples have sadly started to melt together in my memory but this one really stands alone.  It has two towers inside and they were beautiful.  One of the towers was being restored and we got to climb the scaffolding and peak at the man working.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2208 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one amazing picture!  That new lens has really been paying off!</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2210 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this amazing?</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2215 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Here is the man working on the tower.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2219 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2222 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2226 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2227 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2228 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s me and my man!</p>
<p>Well, on another note, we are doing very well.  I have been grinding away on my applications and Chad has been AMAZING through it all.  He deserves lot&#8217;s of high-fives.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone is doing well.  This is out last Christmas in Korea.  We are pretty excited &#8211; there are a lot of wonderful things coming up!</p>
<p>Oh, and Molly will be here in 2 weeks then we get to go to the Philippines!  Lucky dogs!</p>
<p>Kate &amp; Chad</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the Samcheok Office of Education hosted an English Festival for all of the Elementary and Middle Schools.  This 3 day event was mainly a competition consisting of speeches, skits, and quiz games.  Our school participated in all of the events and Kate and I judged a few of the events as well.  All in all it was a fun few days and a nice break from being at school :).  Here are some pictures from the event.  For the full album visit <a title="English Festival" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/english-festival/">this page</a>.</p>

<p>We did &#8220;Who&#8217;s on First&#8221; for our skit.  It was pretty great &#8211; at least we thought so.  They did a great job and I think they understood it which was great.  This is Who, What, and I don&#8217;t know &#8211; the players.</p>

<p>Throughout all of this &#8211; Kate was more nervous than any of the students.  But they all did a great job and Kate made it out alright too <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a photosynth I took while in Seoul last month.  It took me quite a while to get this online because I had about 400 pictures and needed to edit them down to about 300 for the program to work correctly.  I hope you enjoy it &#8211; it&#8217;s an interesting way to see Seoul.</p>
<p><a title="Seoul Tower" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Seoul_Tower" target="_blank">N-Seoul Tower</a> is a &#8220;space-needle&#8221; like tower in the middle of seoul on a big hill.  Great view &#8211; but it was a bit cloudy the day we were there so it&#8217;s hard to see everything in the pictures.  Still impressive though.  Hopefully you can see enough to get an idea of just how large the city is.  Pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Again you might need to download a plugin to view the photosynth.</p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chad and I have had a crazy schedule recently.  We had a huge demo class at our school that required weeks of preparation and renovation and then we quickly ran to Seoul for me to take the GRE.  After less than 12 hours home we boarded a bus to tour the DMZ.  We got home last night.  In about two weeks the Board of Education is hosting an English festival.  We received a paper today that one of our students, Jin Mi Guem (gin like gin and tonic, me like me, guem like chewing gum), wrote to read at the festival.  She is in 4th grade.  Her English is great and she is one of our favorite students.  Surprise!</p>
<p>The reason I want to share this with you is that reading this essay  proved to us that the little things we do are paying off.  Not soon after we arrived here we realized that we were not in Korea to make sure everyone can respond to &#8220;How are you?&#8221; twenty different ways.  We are here as diplomats of the English language and western culture.  Our goals became much bigger that the difference in the pronunciation of &#8216;rice&#8217; and &#8216;lice.&#8217;   Every time we reach out to those kids and accept them for who they are and for what they already know, they will become more and more comfortable with us and our way of life.  Every time Chad treats me as an equal or says that he cooked dinner he is showing the students that  women and men are equal.  It&#8217;s a much bigger goal than we had originally anticipated but much more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Mi Guem&#8217;s essay proved to us that our efforts are working.  The entire essay can be read bellow but the parts that pertain to my blog post are in boldface.</p>

<p><strong>STOP</strong></p>
<p>I think I could write an entire book about Mi Geum&#8217;s essay.  I hope that every foreign teacher with goals similar to ours gets to see how his or her work effected their students.</p>
<p>A note, most of you have probably picked up on the name thing here.  How you address someone is incredibly important.  We have been making a point to always be respectful to everyone &#8211; not just those above us. I love the Mi Guem thinks Kate and Chad are our last names.   Chad made a post recently, <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/annoying-our-students/">Annoying Our Students</a>, in it we are teasing them about not understanding when they ask if Chad and I are a couple.  In the first video I say that Mi Guem is my friend, she spazzes out and says &#8220;No, you are my teacher!&#8221;  It&#8217;s cute, especially after reading this essay.</p>
<p>- &#8211; -</p>
<p>On another note, look forward to more pictures!  Chad sold our two old digital cameras and got an amazing new lense!  He had some great pictures of our DMZ trip but some are now gone, that&#8217;s for another blog post.</p>
<p>One more final tidbit from the lived of Chad and Kate, I took the GRE on Saturday.  My last name, Korroch, is smack bad between Kim and Lee.  I had to raise my hand and ask that the protor read the directions in English!</p>
<p>Chad is out getting a haircut and curry ingrediants.  He is wonderful.  :)  I&#8217;m about to start nursing my cold with some Ugly Betty and EMERGEN-C.</p>
<p>OH, MY SISTER MOLLY IS COMING HERE FOR TWO WEEKS IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>Happy Hump Day!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Kate &amp; Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When we returned from our trip to America I brought back my favorite kind of sketch book.    When it comes to drawing I am not a Moleskin fanatic.  My best quick sketches come from square sketch books &#8211; they can be rectangular or square.  Last month I set a goal to do at least two quick sketches every week.  I have actually stuck to it.  My sketch book has tagged along on every weekend adventure and it has gotten some attention.</div>
<div>I am doing this for many reasons.  First of all, when I lived in Cortona I was graded on the sketch book I kept.  The result of that exercise was countless memories from my time there.  Despite the fact that I express myself visually, I am oblivious to the visual world.  Unless I sit down and spend time with it it is lost on me.  The other main reason I am doing this is to regain my drawing skills.  I used to be good at drawing at I&#8217;ve lost that.  Painting is an easy way to ignore drawing.  Drawing is a fundamental.  Without that structure any piece of art, realistic or abstract, is weak.</div>
<div>To hold myself accountable I will be sharing a few of these sketches on my blog.  I hope you enjoy them!</div>
<p><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/nextgen/kate-sketches/sept28sketchiiicombo.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5391299544626401186" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 247px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/StG-Xxsuj6I/AAAAAAAABL8/E_Nste_OvwQ/s400/sept28sketchi%26iicombo.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="247" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;">Sept 28, 2009, Samcheok-si, South Korea</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>As you can see, this image is of two sketch merged together.  Chad and I climbed the big hill in Samcheok one night to have a picnic. As he snapped pictures I drew the ship yard on the East Sea/Sea of Japan.  I did a couple of quick sketches of the shipyard then settled into the one on the left.  For better context I did the other sketch &#8211; I wanted to remember the contrast of the shipyard and the rolling coast.  If you let your eyes wander to the left you can get a little bit of the vast feeling from the ocean. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>While I was drawing there was a Korean man with me in the pagoda.  He sat for a long time then got up and did a bunch of exercises for a good ten minutes.  As he was preparing to go he came up to me and told me that he liked my camera case.  My camera case is an old gift card bag from Anthropologie.  He was pretty sweet, didn&#8217;t speak a word of English.  We said good-bye and then Chad arrived for the picnic. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">This is the view south up the coast towards Donghae.  We go to Donghae for sandwich sized wheat bread.  More than once we have seen huge ships going in and out of that port &#8211; once we even saw a submarine!  This particular day was one of relaxing in the sand.  We were surrounded by Koreans playing in the water.  There was a group of Koreans there from a tour bus.  They were very enamored with us and one even asked for a picture together.  A a little while after he came back because he wasn&#8217;t happy with the first picture.  I held out my hand and said, &#8220;Mon won!&#8221; which means &#8220;Ten dollars!&#8221;  Luckily, he laughed. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">The next two sketches are from a bit further down the beach in the little cove you can see in the sketch above.</span></div>

In this little grilling cove we are surrounded by rocks, the ocean, a bit of sand, barbed wire, and a military lookout point complete with a gun rest.  These lookouts are scattered every kilometer or so along the coast.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I didn&#8217;t finish this sketch but I like it.  Gareth and Chad were waiting for the grill to heat up while I sketched.  As I started this drawing everyone else arrived.  I love drawing figures.  I have a long way to go to get back into shape but I still enjoy it. </span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today Kate and I took a walk out past the Expo center, took a random turn up a small road and ended up walking through some amazing farms in the hills.  We see small farms and fields everywhere but these were really beautiful.  The weather was great so there were a lot of people out working.  Here are a few pictures I took while we were out.  I did a bit of doctoring in Aperture on some of them.  Tomorrow we&#8217;re planning on going down to the ocean to take some pictures and so Kate can draw.  The waves are huge right now due to the typhoon off of the coast of Japan.   If I get any good shots I&#8217;ll post them too.  It&#8217;s our negative 300 day anniversary today <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   (300 days until our wedding!).  We&#8217;re  going out to dinner with the Lithuanians tonight but we&#8217;ll celebrate with lunch near the ocean tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having some fun with photoshop lately so I thought I&#8217;d share what I&#8217;ve been up to.  These are just a few photos I&#8217;ve tinkered with or put together with photoshop.  Nothing too special but some interesting shots.</p>
<p>Click the images to see a larger version&#8230;</p>
<p>1.   This was taken on Samcheok beach back in June or July.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/beach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-876  aligncenter" title="beach" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/beach-300x131.jpg" alt="beach" width="300" height="131" /></a> <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama.jpg"></a></p>
<p>2.  I took the panorama a few weeks ago from Samcheok Mountain.  It&#8217;s facing toward the sea port and you can see the bright lights of the squid boats out in the water.  That&#8217;s not exaggerated.. they really are that bright.  (click this image once.. then again to see an even larger version.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-875    aligncenter" title="samcheok-shipyard-panorama" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama-300x98.jpg" alt="samcheok-shipyard-panorama" width="300" height="98" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">3. I love this picture of Kate!  It&#8217;s pretty cheesy I know and the vingetting is really strong .. but that&#8217;s what I was trying to learn how to do .. hah so enjoy that beautiful smile <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/katebeach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-874  aligncenter" title="katebeach" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/katebeach-200x300.jpg" alt="katebeach" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">4. Jump!  This was taken last semester during a traditional korean festival day at school.  This is a popular traditional Korean game.  Just some simple dodge and burn to accentuate the action.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/jump.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-873   aligncenter" title="jump" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/jump-200x300.jpg" alt="jump" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">5. This is my first attempt at an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" target="_blank">HDR photo</a> &#8211; (High Dynamic Range).  It was taken from the mountain in Samcheok (of Samcheok) and wasn&#8217;t intended to be an HDR photo.  I was taking some shots for a panorama but I think it turned out alright.  It&#8217;s my first attempt so don&#8217;t judge it too harshly.  My dodge and burn attempts are reallllly spotty but that&#8217;s not what I was trying to learn how to do.  It was also a really gloomy/dark day &#8211; so it was a tough day to shoot pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-872    aligncenter" title="samcheok-hdr" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-hdr-300x200.jpg" alt="samcheok-hdr" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll be posting some pictures from a hike we did the other day at Hwansangul soon.  We&#8217;re hosting our first Couch surfers tonight &#8211; so I&#8217;m going to go be social with them.  Some nice Lithuanian girls who are in Seoul for the Semester.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Kate and I went on a field trip with our school to the Uljin Nuclear Facility &#8211; more on that later but we also went up to this small pagoda overlooking the ocean.  I took this set up photos and uploaded it to <a href="http://photosynth.net" target="_blank">photosynth.net</a> &#8211; a microsoft photo project and here&#8217;s how it turned out!!  Not amazing but it&#8217;s still cool.  I&#8217;ll start uploading the photos for the better one I took in Seoul from Seoul Tower soon.  It takes a long time for the software to do it&#8217;s thing but it does some really cool stuff.  Enjoy.</p>
<address>Note: This may require you download the Silverlight plugin.  It&#8217;s quick and easy &#8211; just a plugin like quicktime or windows media.</address>
