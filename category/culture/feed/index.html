				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Hi Everyone!  here is the El Nido installment!  This is a rather large post laden with videos that I suggest you watching.  We got a little obsessed with our water proof camera case!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 12, 2010 06:19 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4331973132_f706e81eba_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4331973132_f706e81eba_m.jpg" alt="January 12, 2010 06:19 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t know if Chad mentioned that it was raining A LOT when we were in El Nido.  Above is a picture of Chad on our first day.  We were famished and dirty from the bus ride.  We just sat and watched the waves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 12, 2010 06:21 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4331973524_35fab66aa7_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4331973524_35fab66aa7_m.jpg" alt="January 12, 2010 06:21 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">A view from the restaurant in our hostel.  Watch out for sea spray!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 13, 2010 11:20 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4331973898_fcb6f7ff54_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4331973898_fcb6f7ff54_m.jpg" alt="January 13, 2010 11:20 AM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have to say, yes, I went to the Philippines because I wanted some Vitamin D.  That being said, it was really wonderful to see the islands surrounded by storms.  You never see clouds in a postcard.  Despite the fact that we couldn&#8217;t run around in the sand without being pelted by rain drops, it was very beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 13, 2010 05:30 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2614/4331238233_428f45bdb8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2614/4331238233_428f45bdb8_m.jpg" alt="January 13, 2010 05:30 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One our second day the weather cleared up by the late afternoon so we decided to take a sunset cruise.  Cleared up meaning we could walk without being drenched.  It was a rocky boat ride but it was nice to get out and Chad took some magnificent photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 13, 2010 05:36 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/4331976518_f48aa0d97e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/4331976518_f48aa0d97e_m.jpg" alt="January 13, 2010 05:36 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the third day we decided to sign up for an island hopping tour and brave the weather which cooperated above and beyond our expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 14, 2010 09:40 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4331240139_d9a8a7cea5_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4331240139_d9a8a7cea5_m.jpg" alt="January 14, 2010 09:40 AM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Sunshine!  We are so happy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Next is a video of me waving.  Woot.  You can tell we were adjusting to the underwater filmography.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">This is probably me favorite video (LaGOONy).  Chad head butts the camera and when the lens is in and out of the water it looks like we have HUGE bodies and tiny heads.  Oh, and NAME THAT TUNE!  Sorry, it&#8217;s me and not Chad singing!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">We finally found fish!  This spot was amazing.  We saw more fish here that our entire diving trip in Thailand last year!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Our final day we decided to do a cliff climb.  It was fantastic.  Just us and the guide and limestone!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, after the sunset sail we went on an evening swim in the ocean.  I got in a fight with a stray board &#8211; it won.  While we were snorkeling my wounds got sunburned!  You can tell that I had fun!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 16, 2010 06:58 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4331251027_4652cd5879_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4331251027_4652cd5879_m.jpg" alt="January 16, 2010 06:58 AM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Time to go back to Puerto Pincessa.  Above is the kind of bus we took to El Nido.  Below is the less comfortable option we took back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 16, 2010 06:59 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4331989420_859a725cd4_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4331989420_859a725cd4_m.jpg" alt="January 16, 2010 06:59 AM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Next, Bohol!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">In other news, we are doing really well!  I can&#8217;t believe that our time here is almost up.  We finish at school next Wednesday, we leave Samcehok a week from tomorrow, then we take off for Beijing on the 4th!  Also, we will officially be back in Chicago on the 19th of April at 3:10 PM!  YAYY!!  We can&#8217;t wait to get home and see all of our family and friends!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Thank you for keeping Grandpa Baird in your thoughts &#8211; keep it up!  He is improving to the point of serenading Grandma Baird on her birthday/Valentine&#8217;s Day!  We are very happy!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Well, it&#8217;s time to look for some more Couch Surfers for our trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">See you two months from today!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Love, Kad &amp; Chate</p>

<blockquote><p>NOTE: Our school was designated a &#8220;Garden School&#8221; earlier this year and given some huge amount of money to renovate and redesign the programming.  Kate and I have no idea really why our school was given this &#8220;honor&#8221; but we can assume it has something to do with our Vice Principal who last year was a supervisor at the office of education, so he has lots of connections.  This all doesn&#8217;t really affect us toooo much except that everyone is going crazy trying to figure out how to spend all the money and we&#8217;re cramming in a bunch of field trips before the end of the school year to use some of it up.  Hence.. the double field trip day.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 4-6 graders went to Seoul for 2 days to visit another Garden school and to see some museums etc.  The 1st-3rd graders went to <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/62/">Gyeungju</a>.  This city is about 3 hours south of Samcheok and used to be one of the dynasty capitals before the country was unified and Seoul became the capital.  We&#8217;re talking 600-1000 years ago&#8230;  So we toured some of the major historic sites, a museum, and a famous Buddhist temple.  I&#8217;m glad we got to go on this trip even though the 1st-3rd graders are more difficult to handle than the older kids.  We&#8217;ve seen Seoul so many times, it was nice to check off another place (even if our trip was very fast and not at all comprehensive <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ).</p>
<p>Here are some of our pictures from the trip.  If you&#8217;d like to see the full gallery check it out in the photo pages or click <a title="Gyeungju" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/gyungju-field-trip/">here</a>.</p>
<p>*A note to the reader, Chad did the grunt work for this and I am filling in the captions.  Now you know why Chad suddenly became much more effeminate.  It&#8217;s just me!    -K</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2174 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>The sunrise on our way to see the old city.  We have to leave at 7!</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2177 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Approaching the tombs.  They are from the Silla dynasty (they think).  They were enormous and I think they are one of Korea 1 billion wonders.  I think we saw about 10 that day.  They are scattered all over the place which was very striking when we were driving up.  Did we mention the cold?  It was cold.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2181 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2182 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2186 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one of the fist astronomical observatories in Korea!  It&#8217;s next to the tombs.  We stopped there long enough for each class to get a picture then we moved on.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2187 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2189 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2194 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Next we visited the old royal palace.  If my memory serves me well I&#8217;d say it burned down a few hundred years ago and the building are abotu 20 years old (replicas).  There was a time lapse.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2197 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2202 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2205 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Now we are visiting a temple.  I have to say, the Korean temples have sadly started to melt together in my memory but this one really stands alone.  It has two towers inside and they were beautiful.  One of the towers was being restored and we got to climb the scaffolding and peak at the man working.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2208 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one amazing picture!  That new lens has really been paying off!</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2210 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this amazing?</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2215 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Here is the man working on the tower.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2219 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2222 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2226 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2227 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2228 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s me and my man!</p>
<p>Well, on another note, we are doing very well.  I have been grinding away on my applications and Chad has been AMAZING through it all.  He deserves lot&#8217;s of high-fives.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone is doing well.  This is out last Christmas in Korea.  We are pretty excited &#8211; there are a lot of wonderful things coming up!</p>
<p>Oh, and Molly will be here in 2 weeks then we get to go to the Philippines!  Lucky dogs!</p>
<p>Kate &amp; Chad</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chad and I have had a crazy schedule recently.  We had a huge demo class at our school that required weeks of preparation and renovation and then we quickly ran to Seoul for me to take the GRE.  After less than 12 hours home we boarded a bus to tour the DMZ.  We got home last night.  In about two weeks the Board of Education is hosting an English festival.  We received a paper today that one of our students, Jin Mi Guem (gin like gin and tonic, me like me, guem like chewing gum), wrote to read at the festival.  She is in 4th grade.  Her English is great and she is one of our favorite students.  Surprise!</p>
<p>The reason I want to share this with you is that reading this essay  proved to us that the little things we do are paying off.  Not soon after we arrived here we realized that we were not in Korea to make sure everyone can respond to &#8220;How are you?&#8221; twenty different ways.  We are here as diplomats of the English language and western culture.  Our goals became much bigger that the difference in the pronunciation of &#8216;rice&#8217; and &#8216;lice.&#8217;   Every time we reach out to those kids and accept them for who they are and for what they already know, they will become more and more comfortable with us and our way of life.  Every time Chad treats me as an equal or says that he cooked dinner he is showing the students that  women and men are equal.  It&#8217;s a much bigger goal than we had originally anticipated but much more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Mi Guem&#8217;s essay proved to us that our efforts are working.  The entire essay can be read bellow but the parts that pertain to my blog post are in boldface.</p>
<p><span>안녕하세요. 만나서 반갑습니다.</span></p>

<p><strong>STOP</strong></p>
<p>I think I could write an entire book about Mi Geum&#8217;s essay.  I hope that every foreign teacher with goals similar to ours gets to see how his or her work effected their students.</p>
<p>A note, most of you have probably picked up on the name thing here.  How you address someone is incredibly important.  We have been making a point to always be respectful to everyone &#8211; not just those above us. I love the Mi Guem thinks Kate and Chad are our last names.   Chad made a post recently, <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/annoying-our-students/">Annoying Our Students</a>, in it we are teasing them about not understanding when they ask if Chad and I are a couple.  In the first video I say that Mi Guem is my friend, she spazzes out and says &#8220;No, you are my teacher!&#8221;  It&#8217;s cute, especially after reading this essay.</p>
<p>- &#8211; -</p>
<p>On another note, look forward to more pictures!  Chad sold our two old digital cameras and got an amazing new lense!  He had some great pictures of our DMZ trip but some are now gone, that&#8217;s for another blog post.</p>
<p>One more final tidbit from the lived of Chad and Kate, I took the GRE on Saturday.  My last name, Korroch, is smack bad between Kim and Lee.  I had to raise my hand and ask that the protor read the directions in English!</p>
<p>Chad is out getting a haircut and curry ingrediants.  He is wonderful.  :)  I&#8217;m about to start nursing my cold with some Ugly Betty and EMERGEN-C.</p>
<p>OH, MY SISTER MOLLY IS COMING HERE FOR TWO WEEKS IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>Happy Hump Day!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Kate &amp; Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When we returned from our trip to America I brought back my favorite kind of sketch book.    When it comes to drawing I am not a Moleskin fanatic.  My best quick sketches come from square sketch books &#8211; they can be rectangular or square.  Last month I set a goal to do at least two quick sketches every week.  I have actually stuck to it.  My sketch book has tagged along on every weekend adventure and it has gotten some attention.</div>
<div>I am doing this for many reasons.  First of all, when I lived in Cortona I was graded on the sketch book I kept.  The result of that exercise was countless memories from my time there.  Despite the fact that I express myself visually, I am oblivious to the visual world.  Unless I sit down and spend time with it it is lost on me.  The other main reason I am doing this is to regain my drawing skills.  I used to be good at drawing at I&#8217;ve lost that.  Painting is an easy way to ignore drawing.  Drawing is a fundamental.  Without that structure any piece of art, realistic or abstract, is weak.</div>
<div>To hold myself accountable I will be sharing a few of these sketches on my blog.  I hope you enjoy them!</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span>As you can see, this image is of two sketch merged together.  Chad and I climbed the big hill in Samcheok one night to have a picnic. As he snapped pictures I drew the ship yard on the East Sea/Sea of Japan.  I did a couple of quick sketches of the shipyard then settled into the one on the left.  For better context I did the other sketch &#8211; I wanted to remember the contrast of the shipyard and the rolling coast.  If you let your eyes wander to the left you can get a little bit of the vast feeling from the ocean. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>While I was drawing there was a Korean man with me in the pagoda.  He sat for a long time then got up and did a bunch of exercises for a good ten minutes.  As he was preparing to go he came up to me and told me that he liked my camera case.  My camera case is an old gift card bag from Anthropologie.  He was pretty sweet, didn&#8217;t speak a word of English.  We said good-bye and then Chad arrived for the picnic. </span></div>

</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">This is the view south up the coast towards Donghae.  We go to Donghae for sandwich sized wheat bread.  More than once we have seen huge ships going in and out of that port &#8211; once we even saw a submarine!  This particular day was one of relaxing in the sand.  We were surrounded by Koreans playing in the water.  There was a group of Koreans there from a tour bus.  They were very enamored with us and one even asked for a picture together.  A a little while after he came back because he wasn&#8217;t happy with the first picture.  I held out my hand and said, &#8220;Mon won!&#8221; which means &#8220;Ten dollars!&#8221;  Luckily, he laughed. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">The next two sketches are from a bit further down the beach in the little cove you can see in the sketch above.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I</span><span style="font-size:small;"> drew this on the day of our last cookout on the beach.  Every other weekend or so we all go to the beach to grill.  In this little grilling cove we are surrounded by rocks, the ocean, a bit of sand, barbed wire, and a military lookout point complete with a gun rest.  These lookouts are scattered every kilometer or so along the coast.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I didn&#8217;t finish this sketch but I like it.  Gareth and Chad were waiting for the grill to heat up while I sketched.  As I started this drawing everyone else arrived.  I love drawing figures.  I have a long way to go to get back into shape but I still enjoy it. </span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate and I are heading off to Seoul after school today.  It is the middle of the week, but Kate is taking the first part of the GRE tomorrow morning &#8211; it&#8217;s only offered during the week.  I&#8217;m going with her to keep her safe <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   (Wish Kate Luck!!)</p>
<p>School is going really well so far this semester.  The class that gave us the most trouble last semester is much better (so far)&#8230; not sure who&#8217;s to credit for that but we&#8217;re happy.  We&#8217;re feeling very good about our teaching and are pretty well planned out for the semester.  It&#8217;s old routine for us now&#8230;    Knock on wood everything stays this good.</p>
<p>This week we have the Seoul trip, another school field trip, and I have a day off from my small school on Friday due to a sports event.  In two weeks we have a 4 day weekend for the Korean Thanksgiving &#8220;Chuseok&#8221; then in the middle of October and November the classes will have testing for the national assessment.  Then we&#8217;ll be into December and almost done!  Wow it&#8217;s flying by so fast already.</p>
<p>Strange how I&#8217;m already beginning to feel like I need to take every bit of this place in before we leave.  We&#8217;re so lucky to be able to do this.</p>
<p>On another note&#8230; our students LOVE this video.. and I&#8217;m sure you will to.  Be sure to watch for a while&#8230; some funny guest singers pop up <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Weigookin (Foreigner)" src="http://www.driftingfocus.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/foreignerb.png" alt="Weigookin - Foreigner" width="330" height="330" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Weigookin&#8221; &#8211; Foreigner</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes living in Korea as a foreigner and English teacher is a bit like being a celebrity.  Not so much that everyone wants your autograph or there are paparazzi everywhere, although those have both happened, more or less, but more that everyone who sees you is either overly eager to say hello or they&#8217;re terrified.  It&#8217;s never-ending.  Walking down the street a gaggle of middle school girls will pause when they see you, murmur to themselves, then all say in unison, &#8220;Hello!!&#8221;.  This is ALWAYS followed by uproarious laughter &#8211; never fails.  Occasionally we get some more advanced students who will throw questions at you like you&#8217;re a rag doll with a pull string.  &#8220;Where are you from?  Where are you going?  What&#8217;s your name?  How are you? etc&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The other end of the spectrum comes when dealing with older people.  Anyone above the age of 55 is usually pretty confused when we walk into their place of business or walk by them on the street.  You&#8217;d think this was an over generalization but it&#8217;s mostly true.  Old men, &#8220;Ajishees&#8221;, typically just give you the long stare or, if they&#8217;ve been drinking, might try to spurt some incoherent Korean at you.  The old women, &#8220;Ajumas&#8221;, typically have the same stare but sometimes give you a smile of confusion or a look of death&#8230; either/or  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the beginning this was all very interesting for us.  We didn&#8217;t mind being noticed everywhere we went and we just got used to it.  Now after almost 11 months of living here, I have to say it&#8217;s pretty annoying.  The anonymity of living in a culture like America sounds awfully appealing.  It&#8217;s been an interesting phenomenon to experience and one that neither of us will forget.    There aren&#8217;t too many other places on the planet where this kind of experience is possible.  Korea is one of the most homogeneous nations in the world.  They have been known for centuries as &#8220;The Hermit Kingdom&#8221;, and for good reason.  Even after years of foreign influence and cultural exchange comfort levels of average Koreans with foreigners are still very low.  We are, for many people we meet, the first foreigners they&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So with that, we look forward to 12 days from now when we board the plane back to our home country and the comfort of being one of many.  A much needed break.   Then we&#8217;ll come back here with our tanks refilled and do it again for 6 months.  Our trip home will probably bring a whole new set of interesting experiences.  The sudden shift from easily tuning out the Korean ramble on the bus or in restaurants to understand everyone around us perfectly will no doubt be very jarring.  If we act very distracted in public places this is probably why.  I&#8217;m not sure how pronounced that feeling will be but anytime we hear someone speaking in English around us here it immediately draws our attention.   I can&#8217;t imagine when it&#8217;s everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We&#8217;re excited to see the changes in America, good and bad, and then to return to Korea and see it with a fresh eye.  I hope the trip brings to light new appreciation for both cultures and countries.  We&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s my rant for the day&#8230;  We&#8217;ll be home soon!  We are soo excited.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the fall, a few months after we arrived in Korea, our friend Mark told us a horror story about Korean Food.  Mainly this was advice on what to avoid, as he had lived here for a year before.. but it was entertaining and slightly scary to say the least.  The food he told us about was <a title="Chua Tang" href="http://www.tableconversation.com/2006/12/korean_lesson_s.html" target="_blank">Chua Tang</a> (only link I could find).  Here&#8217;s how he described it&#8230; more or less.  (not quoting but what I remember.. with some embellishments for excitement probably <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211;My school took me out to a restaurant near the ocean after work one day for a &#8216;true korean delicacy.&#8217;  I&#8217;d been out with them a lot before and we usually had some reallly good food.  I learned to love korean food with these people.  I&#8217;d eaten some strange things but nothing compared to that night.  We went to a restaurant that was right on the water and the teachers ordered the food.  They just told me fish soup &#8211; I thought alright.. can&#8217;t be too scary &#8211; at least it&#8217;s cooked, right?  That&#8217;s more than usual around here.  So they bring out this contraption that at first I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was.. but now it haunts me.  They grabbed a fish &#8211; (still alive) &#8211; and dropped in the top.  After turning the lever on the side for a bit &#8211; a fine purée of sorts started to fall out the bottom into the bowl below.  They repeated this for all the bowls and handed them out along with the usual side dishes.  I was very confused and really scared, but I tried it anyways.  One bite was all I could take.  After gagging and realizing what I was eating it was just too much to continue.  The luke warm ground fish soup was not for me&#8230;  So &#8211; if your school every says let&#8217;s go get Chua Tang  - SAY NO! &#8211;</p></blockquote>
<p>A few months later, after our winter vacation we came back and the teachers all went out to lunch before the semester started again.  They took us to a small restaurant about 15 minutes from our school and told us we were eating fish soup, chua tang.  Regrettably, Kate and I both had forgotten the name of the soup that Mark had told us about and went along for ride.  This soup was different though.  It was a mix of Duang Jang Jiggae and Chua tang &#8211; or at least it had the Duang Jang spice in it, and it was hot!  Not so &#8216;fresh&#8217; as Mark described.  So we ate it and picked the little bones out of our teeth and didn&#8217;t think too much of it until later that day when we saw Mark and told him we had this strange soup at school that day.  He reminded us of his story and we immediately both had upset stomaches. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   The strangest thing about it was we had eaten it and, at least to the extent of continuing to eat it, liked it.  </p>
<p>I only bring this up now because Kate and I have had Chua Tang at 2 of our last 4 meals.  Yesterday our school went on a &#8216;picnic&#8217; and went fishing in a stream in the mountains near one of our branch schools.  Some of those fish ended up in the soup.  Today we had it again for school lunch!  I hope this is a fluke and it&#8217;s not suddenly Chua Tang Season &#8211; I can only stomach so much of it.  And thinking about too much makes me sick.   </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to get used to things over here.   I think we&#8217;ve done a good job with a lot of it,  but when it comes to things like Chua Tang&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll  just never understand.  <img class="aligncenter" title="Chua Tang" src="http://www.smokefree.com/photos/uncategorized/yeyefishsoup201.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday I left school at 2:30 with my Vice-principle to go to the Samcheok Office of Education.  Kate had left earlier that day at around 1:30 for a volleyball game against some other local school teachers.  The volleyball game happens about once a month and it&#8217;s usually a lot of fun.  Picture 30 Korean teachers playing volleyball (surprisingly well) in a cold gymnasium with the office staff and other teachers (mostly the women) watching and cheering for their teem.  It is always followed by a full out Korean meal experience, which we&#8217;ve grown to enjoy, with our school.  Naturally I was a bit disappointed that I didn&#8217;t get to go play volleyball, no &#8211; scratch that &#8211; I was pretty darn upset that I didn&#8217;t get to.  Not only did I not get to go and Kate did, but I had to go sit in a meeting at the office of education for some reason that I had yet to learn.</p>
<p>The drive to the meeting took abnormally long.  Maybe Kyo Ka Sanseinim (VP) was driving extra slow because we had left a half hour early for a meeting that was at most 15 minutes away.  Maybe it was his odd choice of music &#8211; a strange mix of teenybopper pop and 80s garage band&#8230; all in Korean except for one song with a chorus that went something like &#8220;Ooh I really want you, I really want you.&#8221;  Or maybe he just loves awkwardness and driving around in silence.  More likely, he&#8217;s an upper middle aged man who drives slow and it only felt longer than it actually was.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Office of Education &#8211; a stately new building situated near the Chungsol Apartments (high rises) on top of the hill in Samcheok.  I had been to the building before so this wasn&#8217;t new, but it always means an adventure&#8230;  Never quite sure who will be there, what the meeting will be for, or how long it will take.<br />We walked in and up the stairs to the Education offices.  I was told to wait in the hallway as VP went in to take care of some sort of business before the meeting started.  Meandering through the hallways I was struck by the long sterile hallways of white and grey.  All the doors were closed &#8211; presumably to conserve heat (as each room is individually heated).   I couldn&#8217;t help but equate the space to the bureaucracy and the false perception of efficiency that were the hallmarks of the education system in Korea.  Everything here was clean and eerily tidy out here, but behind the doors. . .</p>
<p>Other Weigooks (foreigners) started to come up the stars with their administrators or co-teachers and we all exchanged glances of confusion and sympathy.  It&#8217;s always amusing to see other foreigners at these meetings because we&#8217;re almost always in the same boat &#8211; we were told of the meeting either 5 minutes before or if we&#8217;re lucky the day before, none of us know what the meeting is really about, we&#8217;re all hoping there isn&#8217;t a dinner afterwards because it&#8217;s always just kind of awkward with the supervisors, we&#8217;re hoping the meeting will be short, and we hope we can understand at least part of it.  We all entered the usual conference style room to see the tables and chairs arranged in a U pattern to facilitate conversation and debate.  It looked like a council meeting in some small town in the states &#8211; except for the banners. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SS1u1Ud8EdI/AAAAAAAAAdo/FoKRkxWJuNk/s1600-h/IMG_4514.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SS1u1Ud8EdI/AAAAAAAAAdo/FoKRkxWJuNk/s320/IMG_4514.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272992601027121618" border="0" /></a>  Koreans are obsessed with banners.  It&#8217;s really quite odd&#8230;  Every event or meeting or activity is accented by a bright colorful banner.  This meeting, of course, was no exception.  A large banner across the front of the room displayed some Korean writing and the date and time of our &#8220;summit&#8221;, if you will.  The head of EPIK in Samcheok was at his desk at the top of the U and would oversee the meeting (with his own banner/poster next to him &#8211; in case we couldn&#8217;t see the big one behind him :).  After everyone was seated in their appropriate seat behind their colorful name plate, the meeting began.  The opening ceremony was short for this one (luckily).  We stood for the national anthem, did the usual introductions and listened to Korean for a while.   William, one of the foreigners in the TaLK program (Teaching and Learning in Korea) translated parts of the meeting into English (usually this does not happen and we are left to decipher on our own&#8230;).</p>
<p>Now we know what the meeting is about &#8211; a forum to discuss our feelings about any issues/problems we&#8217;ve had or ideas we might have about how the EPIK program could be improved.  Our schools would each present how they have decided to structure their English programs and then we would each speak about our experience so far and any suggestions we may have.  We start the presentations and an hour and 15 minutes later (of solid Korean) we start the discussion.</p>
<p>Here is what I find so odd about the Education system here.  The foreign teachers are told to come to this meeting with all of our bosses, with free treats and drinks, and fancy banners, and nameplates &#8211; and then we&#8217;re expected to tell them everything that we don&#8217;t like about our experience so far.               ?                 Although all of us have some problems with our schools or problems with our apartments or problems with some students etc&#8230; we&#8217;re not going to say these things in this kind of meeting.  So, instead, we all go around the circle and say the same thing &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m happy here. My school has been very gracious and I really appreciate it.  It has been hard to adapt to some parts of the culture but overall it&#8217;s been a great experience so far.  The kids are wonderful and I enjoy teaching.&#8221;  Some people throw in a few legitimate suggestions like offering more substantial Korean language lessons to teachers, or teaching more sentence structure to the older students, but none of us really express what we are all thinking &#8211; Stop making us go to pointless meetings like this where we usually don&#8217;t understand anything &#8211; Teach your Korean teachers more English&#8230; it&#8217;s the only way this is really going to work in the long run &#8211; Standardize the experience between schools for foreign teachers by developing (or buying) a curriculum and teaching plan to be followed in after school and co-taught classes and by enforcing more structured standards for living and working environments &#8211; Require that the administrators in charge of English education have at least some grasp of the English Language and an even better understanding of Western Culture.  All of these are legitimate concerns that should be dealt with but they won&#8217;t ever get heard in meetings like these.  It&#8217;s frustrating more than anything.  This byproduct of the Confucianism that is still a part of everything here (although less in the younger generations) is so backwards from the way most of us here think.  We are do-ers, thinkers, debaters, and for the most part tolerant people.  We like to be challenged and made to accept other views or ideas.  We like to get things right by working with everyone involved to perfect the system.  This is of course at the core of what the administrators are trying to do, but until they understand how foreigners react to these meetings and how much more could get done with smaller groups and conversations from the bottom up, not just from the bottom to the top, the system will remain as it is.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t to say a lot of great steps aren&#8217;t being taken.  This fall Korea increased funding for foreign language education in elementary schools by some amazing amount and started requiring that there be one or two full time teachers at almost every school (hence why we are here now).  In recent years they&#8217;ve started teaching English to first and second graders (although I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s mandatory) which is crucial and already obviously working.  But at the same time, more teachers are here and more problems have arisen &#8211; like schools who have never had a foreign teacher not knowing how to deal with them and leaving basically on their own, or teachers having to travel an hour or more to get to their school everyday because there isn&#8217;t enough housing in the small town.  Without all the pomp of these meetings maybe they could get down to fixing some of these issues too.</p>
<p>With all that said- Kate and I are truly happy with our school.  The teachers are all amazing and open to trying to talk to us, the administrators are all friendly and really want to make sure we are comfortable, the students are amazing and inspiring, our commute is never more than 20 minutes, we are usually told when things change in the schedule or meetings/events are upcoming, and most of all we&#8217;re treated like part of the Geundeok Family.  We are extremely lucky.  Many others here have not been as fortunate as we have and we are thankful for our school.  I just hope that the system can be fixed even just a little bit so that more people can have the experience we have had.  After all, we&#8217;re here for the students and the happier we are the better teachers we&#8217;ll be.  Kate always says &#8211; &#8220;If we can leave here in a year with the kids feeling more comfortable and excited about meeting foreigners and learning English, then we were successful.&#8221;  That part is easy if we are happy to come to work everyday.</p>
