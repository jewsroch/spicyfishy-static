		<description><![CDATA[It is wonderful!

I took the Graduate Record Exam - one school to which I&#039;m applying requires it.  Most art school don&#039;t need it!  It was pretty hard to get through but it&#039;s done!  

It sounds like all is well there.  We miss you!

Happy fall!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds wonderful to have the students so well versed in English. And what was the exam you took? The initials do not mean much to me.
Rainy and cool here in IL and the crops are still in the field so farmers very upset and nervous. 
Happy Halloween. 
Love, Grandma and Grandpa]]></description>
