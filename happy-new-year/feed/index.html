		<description><![CDATA[Great!  Jens with beer!  That post made me smile big!  Odd the way things happen.  Glad you liked yoga and are running again.  Meat and no coffee?  Jason and I are big into tea right now.  But I&#039;m moving sort of away from meet a bit.  You both look great!  Can we have a videochat date?  Jason and I fixed up the place a bit...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Love ya!]]></description>
