		<description><![CDATA[Yes it&#039;s coooold.  Especially today...  At least it&#039;s sunny - that always helps.  Glad to hear your snow is melting away.  I love &quot;Sing we now of Christmas&quot;  - always reminds me of a madrigals in high school.  Organ and Bass sounds interesting... Would have loved to have heard that.  Definitely missing the Christmas music over here, but we&#039;ve got a few classics on our computers that we rotate sparingly- so as not to get too sick of them too quickly :)  We&#039;ll be having a multi-religious holiday season this year.  On New  Years eve we&#039;re going to Odaesan National Park to the Woljeongsa Buddhist Temple for a &quot;Temple stay&quot;.  We&#039;ll learn about buddhism and the meaning behind their practices and the temple elements - and participate in the daily rituals of the monks studying there.  Should be an interesting experience.  All we know is we&#039;ll be bowing 108 times at 4 in the morning and doing some intense hiking.  (Told us to bring Crampons!)  Should be memorable.  Kate&#039;s sister will be here for it - we&#039;re giving here a big shot of Asian culture in 10 days :) 
Love,
Chad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So it is cold in Korea too.  We had about 4 inches of snow last Wednesday with white out conditions on the highways. 
Today it is melting some with 38 degrees so happy for that. 
Had a nice church service this a.m. with the christmas carols and our anthem &quot;Sing we now of Christmas&quot; which went well.  Then Grandpa and our new music director played a wonderful offertory-duet with organ and string bass. 
Titled Veni, Emmanuel.......very nice. 
Off to a movie this afternoon. 
Love, Grandma and Grandpa J.]]></description>
