		<description><![CDATA[Wow, fabulous post!  I miss you soooo much!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting about all of the military stuff, I find that sort of display to be very creepy.  I guess it&#039;s better than having a glorified image of it all.  Traffic mannequin = creepy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You had to mention Henry, didn&#039;t you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal sexism is hard to take--maneuvering between trying to respect everyone and not offend will be a challenge.  Eep!  I wonder why status is such a big deal?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just some thoughts!]]></description>
