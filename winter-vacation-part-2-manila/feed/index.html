		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&#039;#comment-2142&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@gi&lt;/a&gt; - Hi Gi, 
Thanks for your comment.  And yes we realize we didn&#039;t really give Manila enough time to find the better sides of it.  It&#039;s just like every big city, there are areas that are not very affluent, and others that are the opposite.  I think where we stayed was in a middle range area but we had to drive through some of the poorest areas to get to the tourist sites.  I think our reaction was mainly based on our surprise at how much poverty there was in the city.  Neither of us realized that was the case before we went so we were more surprised than  anything.  Coming from cities like Seoul and Tokyo it was a change and I think we expected more of a Bangkok feel.   Maybe someday we&#039;ll be able to spend some more time in Manila and have a different experience.  I do have to say though, we enjoyed our time elsewhere in your beautiful country much more :)  

Thanks again for the comment and let us know if you take any great photos!

Thanks for sharing your beautiful country!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there.  I just read your Manila eXperience.  I couldn&#039;t help but comment.  

Well, Manila is not all just poverty (hahaha.. not trying to defend the city). We are poor, yes, but  I hope you were able to stay a little longer and see the good side of my country.  36 hours is too short for you to eXplore the beauty of Manila. =) 

By the way, your photos inspired me to go to those places and do my own amateur photography.  You also made me crave for ice cream!! lol Thanks for visiting Manila.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are by far the best commenter on Spicy Fishy!  Thank you!  Enjoy the snow!  We had about 8 inches while Molly was visiting and really enjoyed it!  Chad is trying to avoid the Super Bowl until we get home so that he can enjoy it American style instead of in a Korean classroom - we&#039;ll see how that goes!  

I&#039;m glad all is well!  XO]]></description>
