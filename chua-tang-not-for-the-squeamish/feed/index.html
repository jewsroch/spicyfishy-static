		<description><![CDATA[CAn&#039;t wait for you to get back here for Texas cake and french fries and hamburgers. 
We had ADDaM camp performance here in Galesburg on Friday night 26th. Great group and even a cello in the band.
WE fed them a hot breakfast and they were so grateful for cold cereal had been the norm all week in Bloomington. 
Friday night they got pizza and salad and fruit. 
Director was Eron Dupree, Chad.  He had been a camper 10 years ago with you.  He is a music teacher in Chicago now. 
Travel safely and anxious to see you in July. 
Love, Grandma]]></description>
