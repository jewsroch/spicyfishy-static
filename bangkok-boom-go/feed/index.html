		<description><![CDATA[I miss the food too. Bibimbap is great, but man could I go for some fresh basil... or pineapple... or basmati rice... or pad thai...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the (lack of) toilet seats - yes, it&#039;s totally crazy. I stayed at a place on Koh Lipe that had two toilets, both western-style bowls with no seat. Every time I balanced up there I was so scared that my foot was going to slip and end up on the inside. Thank God that never happened, but really, I would have much preferred a hole in the ground. Why have a bowl if you&#039;re not going to have a seat?]]></description>
