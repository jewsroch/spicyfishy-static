		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&#039;#comment-1526&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Bill and Willa&lt;/a&gt; - Yeah, we&#039;re not worried about the different culture - that&#039;s what we&#039;re hoping for... and we&#039;re kind of used to feeling like fish out of water now.  We&#039;ll definitely need to be more careful there though.  We&#039;re pretty spoiled here in Korea;  it&#039;s so safe.  We are thinking of adding one stop to the trip... France!!  The tickets to fly home are only $150 more to stop there so we might just do it as a treat before heading back to the grind in America.  

Hope it is warming up there.  We&#039;ve had a few warmer days but still pretty cold here.  Went skiing the other day though and that was a lot of fun.  
I hope this finds you well and stay warm!
Love,
Chad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are both very brave to take off for China for 6 weeks? Be careful out there in the world of such a different culture. 
WE are fine here in Galesburg, altho ready for spring as it has been so0o cold. 
Love and prayers for your safety.
