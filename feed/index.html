				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My apologies for any confusion earlier today. Those of you who are signed up for email notifications may have received a strange email about spicyfishy and namecheap. Basically, I forgot to renew our domain name (spicyfishy.com) so the internet gods stopped letting you get to our site. For some reason, that change prompted an automated email. Sorry about that! </p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; For those of you who are not on Facebook or Instagram, here are some photos from the past few weeks. Also, Kate has been much better about blogging regularly on her site, so be sure to check it out at <a href="http://www.katekorroch.com">www.katekorroch.com</a> ! She&#8217;s pretty amazing! </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><span>Hello Blog Readers,</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">Happy Easter!  Chad and I are enjoying a quiet morning listening to music from the church across the street., eating oatmeal, and getting work done.  Later we will have some friends over.  Yesterday at the grocery store while looking for a vegan cake we found a cake shaped like a lamb&#8211;lamb cake + birthday candles =roasted lamb!  A vegetarian delight!</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m sorry if this post is repetitive for some of you.  I want to share a couple of projects I have going on right now.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: left;">1. I recently launched my first<strong> <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/katekorroch/anybody-out-there-an-art-project-in-china-and-sout?play=1&amp;ref=users">Kickstarter-&#8221;AnyBody Out There?&#8221;</a> </strong>This summer I&#8217;m participating in a residency at <a href="http://www.redgategallery.com/"><strong>Red Gate Gallery</strong></a> in Beijing, China and I&#8217;m going back to South Korea for research. Kickstarter is an online program that helps people raise money for creative projects. Each donation level has an award&#8211;for example for &#8220;AnyBody Out There?&#8221; you can get a limited edition artist book or various original paintings. To get any donation you must hit your goal but you can exceed your goal.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div><img id="BLOG_video-f8a8b69d5ca8ad7f" class="BLOG_thumbnail_class aligncenter" src="http://www.blogger.com/video-thumbnail.g?contentId=f8a8b69d5ca8ad7f&amp;zx=0.2708814605139196" alt="" /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">I hope you enjoy the video! My husband did an amazing job with it.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">2. To go along with my research in China and South Korea, I have created a project about bodies. I have been collecting data and will eventually create art based on my findings. This summer I will have a card which asks people in their native language to describe their bodies. For now I am testing the idea through email, <a href="http://thenowhereyears.blogspot.com/2011/04/reason-3907-why-my-sister-is-coolest.html">blogs like my sister&#8217;s new blog</a>, etc. If you would like to contribute send me this information:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- &#8211; - -</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Please briefly describe your body:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Would you like to be named or anonymous?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Optional:</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Age-</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Gender-</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Nationality-</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">- &#8211; - -</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Thank you for your unending support!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Kate</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve been home for over 2 months now and time is flying by.  Our wedding day is quickly approaching and the details are starting to come together! (We think!)  Right now, Kate is in Virginia with her family spending countless hours bringing the wedding together, applying for scholarships, and enjoying time with her family.  I&#8217;m here in Kokomo with my parents working on my parts of the wedding, training for a sprint triathlon (eeek), and applying for jobs in Chicago!  It&#8217;s an exciting time!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to forego the usual blogger apology for lack of recent updates and I&#8217;m not going to promise anything for the near future because quite frankly we&#8217;re both preoccupied with other things that have to take precedence right now.  But Rest assured that once we are settled in Chicago and have a bit more time to devote to this we&#8217;ll be uploading many more photos and videos from the end of our travels and the past few months.  We&#8217;re on a pretty amazing ride right now and can&#8217;t wait to share it with you!  So, please excuse the hiatus&#8230;</p>
<p>For now, here are a few pictures from the recent months&#8230;</p>
<p>For more detailed descriptions view on flickr &#8211; <a title="Random Photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury/sets/72157624159915971/">click here!</a></p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kate and I were stranded in Paris because of the Icelandic Volcano.  We stayed there for 3 extra days then took bus to Barcelona and on to Madrid where we got a flight home.  It was an adventure and it was ridiculous (and annoying).  Now we&#8217;re fighting battles with the travel insurance company which is very frustrating but in the end it was a nice bonus to get to see spain a bit!</p>
<p>Enjoy the Pictures,  We&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see some of you at the wedding in a few weeks!</p>
<p>-Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello from Cambodia,<br />
We&#8217;re in Siem Reap, home of the Temples of Angkor, for one more night then off to Bangkok and Paris!  We&#8217;ve been here for 4 days and have enjoyed exploring the ancient temples and cities (and the great food).  We haven&#8217;t had much chance to upload any more photos but trust me, we&#8217;ve taken a lot and they will be up someday soon <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>A very quick update: Since we last wrote&#8230;<br />
The overnight Bus was not comfortable and we didn&#8217;t sleep much&#8230;<br />
Hue was interesting and the Nguyen Dynasty tombs were really great&#8230;<br />
The train to Danang was beautiful!  Coast on our left, mountains on our right.  Reminded us of Korea&#8230;<br />
Hoi an was unfortunately pretty forgettable.  Mostly attributable to our poor planning, but it was reallllly touristy and mostly consisted of shopping and eating (which we like, but weren&#8217;t in the mood for just that).  Our hotel was great though and we had a nice bike ride through the country-side&#8230;<br />
Booked the wrong day train tickets to Ho Chi Minh City so our Hotel in Hoi An had to help us rebook them.  All we could get was a Soft Seat (but we ended up on a better train, time-wise) and we didn&#8217;t loose any extra money&#8230;<br />
The train ride was uncomfortable but an experience <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  &#8230;<br />
Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) was busy and crowded but not as much as Hanoi.  We enjoyed about 36 hours there and visited the War Atrocities museum about the Vietnam War.  Not the best museum but still eye opening.  They had a large exhibit about Agent Orange victims&#8230;<br />
Took a bus over the border to Phnom Penh, Cambodia&#8230;<br />
That same day we visited the Killing Fields and S-21 (a high school turned &#8220;security center&#8221; where the Khmer Rouge tortured and killed over tens of thousands people before sending them to the Killing Fields).  So, a long and depressing day&#8230;<br />
The next day we took another bus to Siem Reap&#8230;<br />
Rode bikes to the Temples of Angkor and toured Angkor Thom in the morning and Angkor Wat in the afternoon.  It&#8217;s realllly hot so we take a siesta around noon :)  &#8230;<br />
Hired a Tuk-tuk to drive us around the &#8220;grand tour&#8221; temples (further away than the day before).  Started at Sunrise &#8211; 5AM!! &#8230;<br />
Visited the Ruluos Temples (the oldest in the area) and were back to our hostel by 10:30am&#8230;<br />
Took a cooking class and learned to cook some Amazing Khmer recipes! Can&#8217;t wait to share&#8230;</p>
<p>That brings us up to date!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll spend one night in Bangkok then fly to Paris at 5:20 the next evening.<br />
More when we get to Paris&#8230;  hopefully with more pictures&#8230;<br />
Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all!<br />
We&#8217;ve had some great adventures since our last update but little access to internet (at least internet with a real keyboard).  We&#8217;re in the least planned part of our trip so most of the time when we have wifi or a computer we use it to plan our next move.<br />
Since our last update&#8230;<br />
We finished at Biofarm and headed into Shanghai for one night.  Stayed at a great hostel called the Mingtown for less than 10 dollars!  The next afternoon we took an overnight train to Hong Kong.  The train was great although we were on the top bunk which was a bit cramped.  We met some nice people and arrived without a hitch.<br />
Hong Kong was great!  A nice breather before we jumped back into full-on Asia.  We ate great food, listened to Asians with Brittish Accents and had some great conversations with our fantastic Couch Surfing host, Kirk.  We also got to spend a good amount of time with my friend Marc from the Recording department at IU and his girlfriend Hanni.  We went to their apartment on Lamma Island and wandered around Hong Kong.  Marc plays with the Hong Kong Symphony so he&#8217;s knows the ins and outs and showed us around.<br />
After a few days we headed off again towards Vietnam&#8230;<br />
We took a train to Guangzhou (2 hours) and from there, transfered to the other train station and boarded another overnight train to Nanning, China.  We arrived at 5:30am and transfered over to a bus station and took an 8 hour bus over the boarder to Hanoi, Vietnam!  So, exhausted an icky we quickly found our Couch Surfing host&#8217;s apartment and settled in.  Heidi, a Unesco employee from Finland hosted us and showed us around the CRAZY Hanoi.  She was wonderful and really made us feel welcome (on her first time hosting!).  Hanoi was crazy but a lot of fun.  Motorcycles everywhere, lots of haggling with merchants, and some great food.  We even bought a piece of art!  Pictures will follow someday <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> <br />
Now we are in Ninh Binh.  This town is the hub for a number for famous sights such as Tam Coc and some temples.  We took a day tour from Hanoi this morning and are staying here until 9pm when we get on an overnight Bus down the coast to Hue.  Exausting&#8230;<br />
The plan as of now is&#8230;<br />
Hue for 1 night, to Hoi An the next day, one night in Hoi An, then the train to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), a day there, then off to Phnom Penh in Cambodia for a day, then on to Siem Reap &#8211; home of Angkor Wat!! We&#8217;ll stay there for 3 days then off to Bangkok for a night and then&#8230; PARIS!!  </p>
<p>Here are a few more pictures&#8230; I&#8217;ll try to keep uploading more as soon as possible&#8230;. </p>
<p>Enjoy and we can&#8217;t wait to see you all soon!<br />
-Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all!<br />
After a brief outage, I think the site should be up and running again. Our host was having some issues yesterday.  We&#8217;re in the middle of our spring trip home and are currently in Shanghai, China.  Right now we&#8217;re working on an organic farm outside of Shanghai for about 10 days.  We work for 6 hours a day doing farm work or administrative help (with their website and art projects) and in exchange we get a place to stay and 3 meals a day!  It&#8217;s amazing!  We&#8217;ll post more about that when we have more time but just wanted to update quickly with some pictures from the first 2 weeks of our trip!  We&#8217;re going to put a hold on posting the rest of our Philippines trip pictures, sorry but we didn&#8217;t have a chance to get them uploaded before we sent our computers home.  But don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;ll upload them soon enough.</p>
<p>A quick update of what we&#8217;ve been up to&#8230;<br />
We frantically left our apartment on the 26th of February after being told we had to leave a day earlier because the new teachers were coming!  We stayed with some friends in Samcheok then left for Daegu for a Temple Stay.  We stayed at Haeinsa Temple for one night and had a great experience with the monks there.  Next we headed to Busan (southern Korea City) to visit two friends from IU who just moved there to start teaching English! After a few days there we headed up to Seoul for a day on the high-speed train then flew to Beijing!</p>
<p>I developed a nasty cold while in Korea so we took it pretty slow the first few days in Beijing and stayed in a great hostel just north of the forbidden City.  We visited the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, A few parks in Beijing, The Great Wall, and saw a Peking Opera.  The last two nights we stayed with some lovely Couch Surfers named Prometheus and Lucy and went out for a great Hot Pot!  Beijing was really a lot of fun and we definitely will go back at some point.  (Kate found a number of galleries that have great residency programs!)</p>
<p>Next we took the high-speed train to Shanghai where we are now.  As I said above, we&#8217;re working at the <a href="http://www.biofarm.cn">Biofarm</a> in shanghai and having a great time.  This morning we transplanted seedlings and now we&#8217;re designing some icons for their new website.  (What a vacation!)  We&#8217;re enjoying getting to know the farmers and staff and having a more intimate Chinese experience &#8211; and we&#8217;re learning a thing or two about organic farming too!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a few photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury">flickr </a>so take a look at this gallery for a sample of what we&#8217;ve been up to!  Check back here as we upload more photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Hi Everyone!  here is the El Nido installment!  This is a rather large post laden with videos that I suggest you watching.  We got a little obsessed with our water proof camera case!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t know if Chad mentioned that it was raining A LOT when we were in El Nido.  Above is a picture of Chad on our first day.  We were famished and dirty from the bus ride.  We just sat and watched the waves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 12, 2010 06:21 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4331973524_35fab66aa7_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4055/4331973524_35fab66aa7_m.jpg" alt="January 12, 2010 06:21 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">A view from the restaurant in our hostel.  Watch out for sea spray!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I have to say, yes, I went to the Philippines because I wanted some Vitamin D.  That being said, it was really wonderful to see the islands surrounded by storms.  You never see clouds in a postcard.  Despite the fact that we couldn&#8217;t run around in the sand without being pelted by rain drops, it was very beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 13, 2010 05:30 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2614/4331238233_428f45bdb8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2614/4331238233_428f45bdb8_m.jpg" alt="January 13, 2010 05:30 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One our second day the weather cleared up by the late afternoon so we decided to take a sunset cruise.  Cleared up meaning we could walk without being drenched.  It was a rocky boat ride but it was nice to get out and Chad took some magnificent photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 13, 2010 05:36 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/4331976518_f48aa0d97e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/4331976518_f48aa0d97e_m.jpg" alt="January 13, 2010 05:36 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the third day we decided to sign up for an island hopping tour and brave the weather which cooperated above and beyond our expectations.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">This is probably me favorite video (LaGOONy).  Chad head butts the camera and when the lens is in and out of the water it looks like we have HUGE bodies and tiny heads.  Oh, and NAME THAT TUNE!  Sorry, it&#8217;s me and not Chad singing!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">So, after the sunset sail we went on an evening swim in the ocean.  I got in a fight with a stray board &#8211; it won.  While we were snorkeling my wounds got sunburned!  You can tell that I had fun!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Next, Bohol!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">In other news, we are doing really well!  I can&#8217;t believe that our time here is almost up.  We finish at school next Wednesday, we leave Samcehok a week from tomorrow, then we take off for Beijing on the 4th!  Also, we will officially be back in Chicago on the 19th of April at 3:10 PM!  YAYY!!  We can&#8217;t wait to get home and see all of our family and friends!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Thank you for keeping Grandpa Baird in your thoughts &#8211; keep it up!  He is improving to the point of serenading Grandma Baird on her birthday/Valentine&#8217;s Day!  We are very happy!</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Well, it&#8217;s time to look for some more Couch Surfers for our trip.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">The 3rd post from our Winter Vacation is from one of our more memorable adventures.  After Manila, we took a small plane for about an hour to another island called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawan">Palawan</a>.  (Video Soon!)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Palawan is often called the &#8220;last frontier&#8221; of the Philippines.  It was only claimed by the Philippines in the 1960s after being tossed around between Japanese rule in WWII, American rule earlier in the century, Spanish rule before that, and Malay long ago.  So, as expected this island was much less developed than Manila or our later stops on Bohol and Cebu.  We flew into Puerto Princesa (the capital of the island) and had to stay the night before heading up to El Nido.  We arrived at Manny&#8217;s guest house by <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=philippine+tricycle&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=90t3S577A8qOkQWf2IX6Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBAQsAQwAA">tricycle</a> (there are no taxi&#8217;s on the island &#8211; WATCH THE <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/64/">VIDEO HERE</a>!) just in time to catch this great view of the sunset!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">We took off into town to find some internet and came across this church.  They had 3 masses a day 2 in English and 1 in the local dialect.  Pretty cool!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I think we were hungry!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">The next morning we left at 7am on a local bus for our next stop &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nido,_Palawan">El Nido</a>.  We had the option to take a local bus for 300 pesos each (~$4) or a minivan with aircon for 600 pesos each.  We opted for the cheaper version hoping for more of an adventure &#8230;   The bus was a huge open air giant of a machine and looked like it had been in use since about WWII or so.  The bus slowly filled with all local Philippinos &#8230;. and us (the only foreigners in sight).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">She was our entertainment&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">The bus ride took a solid 8 hours to get from Puerto Princesa to El Nido.  We spent most of the trip admiring the amazing scenery, clinging to the railings as we hurdled down rough pavement, gravel, and dirt roads, or we watched the children sitting in front of us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 12, 2010 10:18 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4331224685_ef4b4a0334_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4331224685_ef4b4a0334_m.jpg" alt="January 12, 2010 10:18 AM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">On top of the bus, people packed on loads of goods to ship, bags, and at one point in the trip&#8230; a motorcycle!  When the bus was full, people sat on the roof.  No one fell off, but I&#8217;m sure there were some close calls with the rough roads and crazy driving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 12, 2010 09:12 AM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4331224237_7281aacc95_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4331224237_7281aacc95_m.jpg" alt="January 12, 2010 09:12 AM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Here&#8217;s another&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">We made it safely to El Nido.  Luckily it only rained for about 20 minutes near the end of the ride.  We&#8217;ve heard horror stories of the bus getting stuck in the mud on rainy days and taking 12-15 hours to get to El Nido.  We also avoided flat tires (another common occurrence).  Video of our arrival into El Nido is below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><object width="437" height="348" data="http://www.viddler.com/simple/9a1c5701/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="id" value="viddler_9a1c5701" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.viddler.com/simple/9a1c5701/" /><param name="name" value="viddler_9a1c5701" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">The bus ride was definitely an adventure.  We chose it because it we wanted to have a more realistic Philippines experience and we got it.  We saw a lot of beautiful sites, but also so the shanties and shacks of rural Philippino life.  We stopped a few times and encountered some begging children, hungry and dirty.  A sad sight and a strange reminder of Manila.  The restrooms along our trip were shacks with holes in the ground or a basic toilet with no seat or water.  Needless to say we limited our water and food so we could avoid them as much as possible.  Many of our companions on the bus didn&#8217;t speak, or didn&#8217;t want to speak English so it was hard to know what was happening when we stopped, or how long we had left on our journey.  But that was all part of the experience.  It was one of our more memorable experiences of the trip and I&#8217;m glad we did it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: center; ">Up Next &#8211; the town of El Nido and it&#8217;s paradise limestone islands!  Oh.. and some great underwater videos!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Please keep my (Chad) grandfather in your thoughts.  He&#8217;s having a rough recovery from knee surgery a few weeks ago.  He&#8217;s doing better the past few days but still has a long road to recovery ahead.  Nothing makes us feel farther away from home than when someone we love is sick.  We just thankful for the wonders of Skype that help us keep in touch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">All the best,</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Hello Everyone!  Chad has been doing an amazing job arranging all of our pictures.  I thought I could contribute and regale you with the tales of our 36 hours in Manila!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 12:56 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4331211833_a692460d2e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4331211833_a692460d2e_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 12:56 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Chad mentioned in <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/winter-vacation-part-1-seoul/">his last post</a>, Molly, Chad and I all left Incheon the same day.  One slight snafue in our planning &#8211; Molly took off at 9:30 AM, we took off at 9:30 PM.  Little did Chad and I know that we would fall in love with the Incheon airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we had our MacDonald&#8217;s breakfast we headed upstairs to find a cozy place to catch up on reading/sleep/picture taking.  Incheon has huge bean bags all over upstairs.  We saw one open up and pretty much sprinted to claim it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Chad took lots of pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">I read lots of D.H. Lawerence&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Love">Women in Love</a></em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I love this picture.  Notice there is only one man who is standing still.  Can you find him?  Ill give you one hint &#8211; he&#8217;s Korean!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 01:35 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4331952718_d206466704_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4331952718_d206466704_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 01:35 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Sleepy heads!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">Hangin&#8217; with D.H.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we landed in Manila at 12:30 AM.  It was beautiful and balmy and the airport made the Indianapolis airport look like the biggest airport in the world!  We got into a cab and had an experience.  The cab driver was appalled at the location of our hostel and spent the entirety of our drive telling us we shouldn&#8217;t go there.  This was between wrong turns and police checkpoints!  Wow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we finally arrived at the hostel it was very nice and the owner was incredibly welcoming.  It was very clean and we had great roommates.  The location was slightly dodgy but we&#8217;re here to tell the tale!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next morning we walked around Rizal Park.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:30 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4331214707_4cb019a879_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4331214707_4cb019a879_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:30 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These kids got super excited when Chad was taking pictures.  They all lined up and jumped around for him!  They are much more active picture takers than our students!  I wish I had my camera out to take picture of Chad taking their pictures &#8211; it was pretty cute.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:33 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4331214993_39a0a7c2d3_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4331214993_39a0a7c2d3_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:33 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is me, Ana (German), and Blanca (Columbian living in China).  They were our roommates in Manila and we spent the day with them.  They were quite lovely ladies!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:42 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4331216215_921c9c4049_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4331216215_921c9c4049_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:42 PM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There were ice cream trucks everywhere and they all constantly played the same ding-dong tune!  After about 3 minutes of wandering around the park we all had it stuck in our heads.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:09 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4331957366_c00514ab0a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4331957366_c00514ab0a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:09 PM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center; ">A view of Chad at work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:15 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4331969404_b1f585f89b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4331969404_b1f585f89b_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:15 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">A view of Chad&#8217;s work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the park and some lunch we headed to a fort commemorating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Rizal">Jose Rizal</a> (every main street in Manila is Rizal Avenue).  Rizal was a huge nationalist/martyr in the Philippines in the late 1800&#8242;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:18 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4331232041_bc6002d68a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4331232041_bc6002d68a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:18 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Below is a view from the top of the fort wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:29 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4331972060_93006b564a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4331972060_93006b564a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:29 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Manila metropolis.  Vastly different from what we left in Seoul.  I had no idea how different it was going to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:31 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4331285453_4b3a097a2a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4331285453_4b3a097a2a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:31 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Gazing at . . . . ?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:33 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4332024000_c87b9f9ba9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4332024000_c87b9f9ba9_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:33 PM" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the day we were very tired.  Instead of fighting to get onto the subway system we decided to hop into a jeepney.  They are bus-jeeps that people jump into for a quick, cheap ride.  Hold on tight!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The next day, right before we headed to the airport, Chad and I decided to check out the Chinese cemetery that was right outside of our hostel.  It vaguely reminded me of the tombs I visited in Cortona 4 years ago.  In the Philippines people really go all out for their deceased loved ones.  Some of the tombs have air conditioning, running water, full fridges, etc.  I think we should have just stayed in one of those!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 11, 2010 01:23 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4332026920_41f4a13b36_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4332026920_41f4a13b36_m.jpg" alt="January 11, 2010 01:23 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">We wanted to take this little guy home but he was too big for our backpacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 11, 2010 01:24 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4332027078_17b1a91bc5_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4332027078_17b1a91bc5_m.jpg" alt="January 11, 2010 01:24 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Manila was a very interesting and educational experience.  We saw a ton of poverty and many people with a much different standard of living then we are used to seeing as the norm.  Chad mentioned some of it in <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/el-nido-update/">a post he made</a> while we were traveling.  I  felt like a naive voyeur the entire time we were in Manila.  It was very sobering and prompted a lot of discussion for the trip.  Who are we to decide what is comfortable and not comfortable?  Who are we to live in a three bedroom apartment with plumbing?  Do they want that?  How do we help?  Do they want help?  Maybe they are perfectly and happy and just because it wouldn&#8217;t make us happy doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t even happier than we are.  There is a fine line and  seeing it is a huge challenge.  I hope that Chad and I remember how that felt and that we manage to do the right thing and not ignore it.  We both want to get back into volunteering when we get home and maybe even while we are traveling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One a lighter note, we are in the midst of arranging our trip for the spring.  Right now we plan to be in China for about a month then we&#8217;ll head through Vietnam to Cambodia.  After that we plan to fly from Bangkok to Paris.  We plan to be home in mid to late April.  We&#8217;ll let you know as things firm up!  We are incredibly excited and each time we sit down to plan we just talk about how crazy it is that we get to see all these amazing places!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, we only have one computer now and I need to get a few things accomplished before I hand it over to Chad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope everyone is doing well and staying warm!  Anyone buried in the snow?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the next few days/weeks we&#8217;ll be posting pictures and stories from our Winter 2010 Vacation.  This is the first installment about the first stop on our adventure &#8211; Seoul.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kate&#8217;s sister, Molly, came to visit us in Korea in late December.  She stayed for about 10 days and we had a great time with her.  It was wonderful to actually get to share this place with someone from home.  The last 4 days that she was here we were off work and we all went to Seoul.  The trip was mainly a whirlwind tour of the city&#8217;s hot spots.  Here are some pictures from Seoul.   There are more in the <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/2010-winter-vacation/seoul-w-molly/" target="_self">gallery</a> to the left.  As always &#8211; click for a larger image.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 04:23 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4321158587_2a705e0839_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4321158587_2a705e0839_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 04:23 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We stopped at a KimBap Restaurant (Korean Fast Food) for a cheap snack before heading off for the afternoon.  This is Ram-bokki a combination of Ramen Noodles and Dakbokki &#8211; spicy sauce and rice cake.  In the background you can see Kim Bap (Korean sushi rolls without the sushi) and Mandu (Korean Dumplings).  Molly had a pretty good amount of Korean food while she was here&#8230; its definitely an experience.  Kate and I love this stuff now <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 06:59 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321897390_ee553bf6c3_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321897390_ee553bf6c3_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 06:59 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There was an Andy Warhol Portraits exhibit at the Seoul Museum of Art, so naturally we checked it out.  It was a coooold night but we ventured out.  The exhibit was fantastic!  A really wide range of his work and a lot of historical information and artifacts about his life.  The English translations of the commentary were also really entertaining.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 6, 2010 07:26 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321891652_51bde48af1_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4321891652_51bde48af1_m.jpg" alt="January 6, 2010 07:26 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We got a little lost walking back to the subway which wasn&#8217;t good because it was about 1 degree outside&#8230;but we made it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 01:59 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2770/4321163887_0b2eae35b0_b.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2770/4321163887_0b2eae35b0_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 01:59 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The next day we went to Bongeun-sa Temple near the Coex Mall.  Every Thursday they have a &#8220;Temple Life&#8221; program where foreigners can get a tour of the temple, learn some basic meditation practices, participate in the Tea Ceremony and make lotus flowers.  It was about 2 hours and a really great way to experience Korean Buddhism up close.  We had hoped to do an overnight Temple Stay the weekend before, but Kate was sick and it didn&#8217;t seem like a good idea.  This was a nice way to still get at least some of the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 02:27 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4321891908_40c23c2593_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4321891908_40c23c2593_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 02:27 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lanterns are hung at the temples for a period of time before and after the four major Buddhist holidays.  I think these were up for the New Year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 02:53 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4321165221_bf21669af9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4321165221_bf21669af9_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 02:53 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is one of the tallest Buddha Statues in Korea.  The picture doesn&#8217;t really do it justice but it was huge!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 03:15 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4321895700_52a792c9d8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4321895700_52a792c9d8_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 03:15 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tea ceremony!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 04:26 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4321159683_7bed68f978_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2744/4321159683_7bed68f978_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 04:26 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kate and Molly making Lotus Flowers</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 04:41 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4321896744_64b71dc95f_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4321896744_64b71dc95f_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 04:41 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Temple is right in the middle of the city &#8211; providing an interesting contrast between the skyscrapers and apartment buildings all around it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 7, 2010 05:28 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4321891216_18126ef8a0_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4321891216_18126ef8a0_m.jpg" alt="January 7, 2010 05:28 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Kate and Molly on the Subway.  Seoul has one of the best subways I&#8217;ve ever been on.  It&#8217;s quiet, clean, and fast&#8230; amazing!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 8, 2010 05:53 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4321892310_59bd310b82_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4321892310_59bd310b82_m.jpg" alt="January 8, 2010 05:53 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The last day we took a bus tour around the city.  This was the easiest and cheapest way to see all the highlights of the city.  It was a fun way to spend the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="January 8, 2010 06:11 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4321892132_6b16cf03db_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4321892132_6b16cf03db_m.jpg" alt="January 8, 2010 06:11 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I think this is Namdaemoon, or Dongdaemoon &#8230;  From the bus.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also went to see Avatar in 3D one afternoon, and ate some Mexican food in Itaewon.  On Saturday we took Molly to the airport for her early morning flight, then we waited there for our 9:30pm flight.  Stuck in the airport for 13 hours&#8230; not too fun.  Incheon is kind of the most amazing airport in the world though, so it was not a problem&#8230; more on that in the next post&#8230; Manila!</p>
