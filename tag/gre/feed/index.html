				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been hoarding a bunch of new pictures for the past few weeks &#8211; waiting for a good time to edit them down and post them.  So here we are.  Be sure to check the captions on the pictures for more information about them.  We&#8217;ve had some great adventures lately and these hopefully capture a bit of them.  I&#8217;ve been trigger happy lately ending up with 5 and 6 hundred photos from some trips, so this is definitely a sampling &#8211; but it&#8217;s really all the pictures anyone would ever actually want to see. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   I&#8217;ll be posting some more photosynths of places around Korea soon too.  (That&#8217;s really where the photo counts go up like crazy! )</p>
<p>Enjoy and please leave a comment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate and I are heading off to Seoul after school today.  It is the middle of the week, but Kate is taking the first part of the GRE tomorrow morning &#8211; it&#8217;s only offered during the week.  I&#8217;m going with her to keep her safe <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   (Wish Kate Luck!!)</p>
<p>School is going really well so far this semester.  The class that gave us the most trouble last semester is much better (so far)&#8230; not sure who&#8217;s to credit for that but we&#8217;re happy.  We&#8217;re feeling very good about our teaching and are pretty well planned out for the semester.  It&#8217;s old routine for us now&#8230;    Knock on wood everything stays this good.</p>
<p>This week we have the Seoul trip, another school field trip, and I have a day off from my small school on Friday due to a sports event.  In two weeks we have a 4 day weekend for the Korean Thanksgiving &#8220;Chuseok&#8221; then in the middle of October and November the classes will have testing for the national assessment.  Then we&#8217;ll be into December and almost done!  Wow it&#8217;s flying by so fast already.</p>
<p>Strange how I&#8217;m already beginning to feel like I need to take every bit of this place in before we leave.  We&#8217;re so lucky to be able to do this.</p>
<p>On another note&#8230; our students LOVE this video.. and I&#8217;m sure you will to.  Be sure to watch for a while&#8230; some funny guest singers pop up <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
