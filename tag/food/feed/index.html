				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the fall, a few months after we arrived in Korea, our friend Mark told us a horror story about Korean Food.  Mainly this was advice on what to avoid, as he had lived here for a year before.. but it was entertaining and slightly scary to say the least.  The food he told us about was <a title="Chua Tang" href="http://www.tableconversation.com/2006/12/korean_lesson_s.html" target="_blank">Chua Tang</a> (only link I could find).  Here&#8217;s how he described it&#8230; more or less.  (not quoting but what I remember.. with some embellishments for excitement probably <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211;My school took me out to a restaurant near the ocean after work one day for a &#8216;true korean delicacy.&#8217;  I&#8217;d been out with them a lot before and we usually had some reallly good food.  I learned to love korean food with these people.  I&#8217;d eaten some strange things but nothing compared to that night.  We went to a restaurant that was right on the water and the teachers ordered the food.  They just told me fish soup &#8211; I thought alright.. can&#8217;t be too scary &#8211; at least it&#8217;s cooked, right?  That&#8217;s more than usual around here.  So they bring out this contraption that at first I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was.. but now it haunts me.  They grabbed a fish &#8211; (still alive) &#8211; and dropped in the top.  After turning the lever on the side for a bit &#8211; a fine purée of sorts started to fall out the bottom into the bowl below.  They repeated this for all the bowls and handed them out along with the usual side dishes.  I was very confused and really scared, but I tried it anyways.  One bite was all I could take.  After gagging and realizing what I was eating it was just too much to continue.  The luke warm ground fish soup was not for me&#8230;  So &#8211; if your school every says let&#8217;s go get Chua Tang  - SAY NO! &#8211;</p></blockquote>
<p>A few months later, after our winter vacation we came back and the teachers all went out to lunch before the semester started again.  They took us to a small restaurant about 15 minutes from our school and told us we were eating fish soup, chua tang.  Regrettably, Kate and I both had forgotten the name of the soup that Mark had told us about and went along for ride.  This soup was different though.  It was a mix of Duang Jang Jiggae and Chua tang &#8211; or at least it had the Duang Jang spice in it, and it was hot!  Not so &#8216;fresh&#8217; as Mark described.  So we ate it and picked the little bones out of our teeth and didn&#8217;t think too much of it until later that day when we saw Mark and told him we had this strange soup at school that day.  He reminded us of his story and we immediately both had upset stomaches. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   The strangest thing about it was we had eaten it and, at least to the extent of continuing to eat it, liked it.  </p>
<p>I only bring this up now because Kate and I have had Chua Tang at 2 of our last 4 meals.  Yesterday our school went on a &#8216;picnic&#8217; and went fishing in a stream in the mountains near one of our branch schools.  Some of those fish ended up in the soup.  Today we had it again for school lunch!  I hope this is a fluke and it&#8217;s not suddenly Chua Tang Season &#8211; I can only stomach so much of it.  And thinking about too much makes me sick.   </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to get used to things over here.   I think we&#8217;ve done a good job with a lot of it,  but when it comes to things like Chua Tang&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll  just never understand.  <img class="aligncenter" title="Chua Tang" src="http://www.smokefree.com/photos/uncategorized/yeyefishsoup201.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div align="left">Drive. Take off. Land. Drive. </div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Saturday morning (the 23rd) we loaded up into Julie and Zane&#8217;s civic (THANK YOU!) and headed off to O&#8217;Hare. When we got to O&#8217;hare we drove to the international terminal, Delta was not listed there so Julie dropped us off at the Domestic Delta terminal. WRONG! We were right the first time. Julie was gone so we slowly arranged oursleves (2 large bags, 1 camping back-pack and one purse/computer bag each) and made our way up down over and around back to the international terminal. No big deal, just bags, bags and bags.</div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Speaking of bags, our bags were perfect. The night before we left Kokomo we loaded into the car and drove to Chad&#8217;s Dad&#8217;s church to weigh our bags. After some shifting around and some major adding to our carry on, all of the bags became about 2 lbs under the weight limit, wiggle room is always good. When we checked our bags the woman asked us if we had weighed ahead of time. We were that spot on! </div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">Okay, big bags gone, we made our way to security. I took off my jewlery, chad got rid of his belt, no problem! I went through, no beeps. My bags went though, no beeps. Chad went through, no beeps. Chad&#8217;s backpack went through, BEEP BEEP BEEP. Okay, no beeps, actually a security oficer&#8217;s face became incredibly stern and staring at the monitor he uttered, &#8220;Oh. My. God.&#8221; Seriously, I watched the man. I felt like I was in some hoaky police movie and I was going to lose Chad to a white room and lots of men in uniforms. Bomb, no, but close to it on a computer screen in the international terminal at O&#8217;Hare. As most of you know, Chad likes electronics. One of his carry on bacgs became harddrive mecca (this was due to the check-in pounds explained above.) He got through fine. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="left"></div>
<div align="left">After a helter-skelter experience at O&#8217;Hare we made it onto the plane safe and sound. The plane gently transported us for 14 hours over Canada, Alaska and Russia (that what I can remember) we landed in Incheon (and island slightly west of Seoul). At Incheon we got through customs with no bumps. </div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLj0A6Wj_AI/AAAAAAAAAcc/WjE0O-38pMI/s1600-h/IMG_4120.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240206462946638850" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLj0A6Wj_AI/AAAAAAAAAcc/WjE0O-38pMI/s320/IMG_4120.JPG" border="0" height="218" width="306" /></a> Lunch on the plane. So yummy! </div>

Due ot the fact that we do not look Korea, the flight attendant took some pitty on us and handed us an instruction sheet for our lunch!</p>

Along with the Bibimbap there was seaweed soup, a roll, two side dishes of vegtables and wine. I am getting a little ahead of myself but I just want to mention that our meal on the plane was the last meal we had before we ate Korean&#8217;s version of Western food in a caffeteria for about 5 days. We should have taken more pictures.</p>
<p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLjxehaOr1I/AAAAAAAAAcE/rBQsINniGxY/s1600-h/IMG_4132.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240203673112325970" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLjxehaOr1I/AAAAAAAAAcE/rBQsINniGxY/s320/IMG_4132.JPG" border="0" /></a> </div>
<p>
<div align="center">This picure is not that interesting but the little man we saw when we took this picture was. As we drove through the toll booth we were sternly greeted by figures in orange militant looking uniforms. Each figure was adorned with a tan face mask complete with eye holes.</div>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLjxHKPth1I/AAAAAAAAAb8/JcbpqauUS9Q/s1600-h/IMG_4126.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240203271757203282" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SLjxHKPth1I/AAAAAAAAAb8/JcbpqauUS9Q/s320/IMG_4126.JPG" border="0" /></a> Maybe my favorite picture so far, the first scultpure we found in Korea! It was right outside of the airport.</p>
