<p><a title="Seoul Tower" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_Seoul_Tower" target="_blank">N-Seoul Tower</a> is a &#8220;space-needle&#8221; like tower in the middle of seoul on a big hill.  Great view &#8211; but it was a bit cloudy the day we were there so it&#8217;s hard to see everything in the pictures.  Still impressive though.  Hopefully you can see enough to get an idea of just how large the city is.  Pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Again you might need to download a plugin to view the photosynth.</p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We&#8217;re back in Korea now for our last 6 months and I&#8217;m finally getting around to putting these photos up.  We&#8217;ve been home for almost 2 weeks now but time is already flying by.  We started back to school this week and things are going pretty well so far&#8230;</p>
<p>Our trip to the USA was amazing.  Thanks to our Families and Friends for being flexible and seeing us whenever it was possible.  We were so happy to see everyone and so thankful that we were able to spend so much time with so many of you.  We also were pretty happy for the food too <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>In our 4 week whirlwind tour we visited nearly 20 cities, 5 states, and a LOT of people.  We packed a lot in but it was an amazing month&#8230; one we won&#8217;t ever forget and will cherish and miss while we finish our last 6 months in Korea.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll have some new posts up very soon with more substance about the changes we saw and reverse/reversereverse culture-shock.  We&#8217;ll also be posting about what&#8217;s next and our plans for these 6 months.  (aka save money, then go to china and nepal on our way home&#8230;)</p>
<p>Here are a few albums of pictures that I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy.  If you&#8217;re on facebook you might have already seen these but there might be a few new ones here.. (and they&#8217;re much better quality here. &#8211; booo facebook photos).</p>
<p>Enjoy!  Please leave some comments <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
