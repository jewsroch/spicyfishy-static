				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve been home for over 2 months now and time is flying by.  Our wedding day is quickly approaching and the details are starting to come together! (We think!)  Right now, Kate is in Virginia with her family spending countless hours bringing the wedding together, applying for scholarships, and enjoying time with her family.  I&#8217;m here in Kokomo with my parents working on my parts of the wedding, training for a sprint triathlon (eeek), and applying for jobs in Chicago!  It&#8217;s an exciting time!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to forego the usual blogger apology for lack of recent updates and I&#8217;m not going to promise anything for the near future because quite frankly we&#8217;re both preoccupied with other things that have to take precedence right now.  But Rest assured that once we are settled in Chicago and have a bit more time to devote to this we&#8217;ll be uploading many more photos and videos from the end of our travels and the past few months.  We&#8217;re on a pretty amazing ride right now and can&#8217;t wait to share it with you!  So, please excuse the hiatus&#8230;</p>
<p>For now, here are a few pictures from the recent months&#8230;</p>
<p>For more detailed descriptions view on flickr &#8211; <a title="Random Photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury/sets/72157624159915971/">click here!</a></p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kate and I were stranded in Paris because of the Icelandic Volcano.  We stayed there for 3 extra days then took bus to Barcelona and on to Madrid where we got a flight home.  It was an adventure and it was ridiculous (and annoying).  Now we&#8217;re fighting battles with the travel insurance company which is very frustrating but in the end it was a nice bonus to get to see spain a bit!</p>
<p>Enjoy the Pictures,  We&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see some of you at the wedding in a few weeks!</p>
<p>-Chad</p>
