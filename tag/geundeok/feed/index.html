				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; ">We had school pictures a couple of months ago and our teachers all took these two pictures together.  We also took individual photos, which we never saw, but we were given these a few days later &#8211; just getting around to posting them now, sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The first is a standard posed picture &#8211; (from the roof of the school) with all of the Geundeok teachers and staff.  This is everybody <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[singlepic id=2229 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: left;">The second picture is a new-age-awesomeness picture envisioned by the artiste photographers&#8230; If we were a band, we would be awesome&#8230; but we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re elementary school teachers &#8211; so it&#8217;s just goofy.  But that&#8217;s Korea!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">[singlepic id=2230 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of these people are really amazing.  We&#8217;ve become great friends with a number of them and will miss them greatly when leave in a few months.  One advantage of being at such a small school is that it&#8217;s really like an extended family.  I know every one of these people pretty well and some of them are really our best friends in Korea.  That&#8217;s much less possible at a school with 80 teachers that is departmentalized and divided.   I&#8217;d list the names and positions of everyone in the picture but it would probably be silly.  Our closest friends are the woman on the far left (black sweater tan skirt) &#8211; She&#8217;s the 5th grade teacher, teacher Kim Young-mi and is a year older than us.  She came this year from Taebaek and has been a great friend!  Can&#8217;t imagine the past year without her great sense of humor and fantastic English.  The woman in the front with the White Jacket (younger woman) is our official Co-teacher, Son Eun-Jin.  She&#8217;s amazing!  Such a fantastic friend and always willing to help us when we have problems.  (And she&#8217;s the hardest working person in our school <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) In front of Kate (to the left a bit) in all black is Teacher Kim Suk-jin.  She was our first friend here in Korea and really helped us a lot our first semester here.  She was in the U.S. last summer studying English and is now teaching most of our classes with us (long story).  She&#8217;s great and we will miss her a lot.  Hopefully some of these ladies will come to our wedding!!  There are a number of other teachers I&#8217;d love to tell you about and surely will sometime soon, but for now that&#8217;s it <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Just wanted post these pictures while I was thinking of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the best&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kate and I are enjoying homemade apple pie and whip cream tonight.  Thanks KATE!</p>

<p>Recently our school went on a double field trip day with some of our Garden school funding.</p>
<blockquote><p>NOTE: Our school was designated a &#8220;Garden School&#8221; earlier this year and given some huge amount of money to renovate and redesign the programming.  Kate and I have no idea really why our school was given this &#8220;honor&#8221; but we can assume it has something to do with our Vice Principal who last year was a supervisor at the office of education, so he has lots of connections.  This all doesn&#8217;t really affect us toooo much except that everyone is going crazy trying to figure out how to spend all the money and we&#8217;re cramming in a bunch of field trips before the end of the school year to use some of it up.  Hence.. the double field trip day.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 4-6 graders went to Seoul for 2 days to visit another Garden school and to see some museums etc.  The 1st-3rd graders went to <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/62/">Gyeungju</a>.  This city is about 3 hours south of Samcheok and used to be one of the dynasty capitals before the country was unified and Seoul became the capital.  We&#8217;re talking 600-1000 years ago&#8230;  So we toured some of the major historic sites, a museum, and a famous Buddhist temple.  I&#8217;m glad we got to go on this trip even though the 1st-3rd graders are more difficult to handle than the older kids.  We&#8217;ve seen Seoul so many times, it was nice to check off another place (even if our trip was very fast and not at all comprehensive <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ).</p>
<p>Here are some of our pictures from the trip.  If you&#8217;d like to see the full gallery check it out in the photo pages or click <a title="Gyeungju" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/gyungju-field-trip/">here</a>.</p>
<p>*A note to the reader, Chad did the grunt work for this and I am filling in the captions.  Now you know why Chad suddenly became much more effeminate.  It&#8217;s just me!    -K</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2174 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>The sunrise on our way to see the old city.  We have to leave at 7!</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2177 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Approaching the tombs.  They are from the Silla dynasty (they think).  They were enormous and I think they are one of Korea 1 billion wonders.  I think we saw about 10 that day.  They are scattered all over the place which was very striking when we were driving up.  Did we mention the cold?  It was cold.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2181 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2182 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2186 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one of the fist astronomical observatories in Korea!  It&#8217;s next to the tombs.  We stopped there long enough for each class to get a picture then we moved on.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2187 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2189 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2194 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Next we visited the old royal palace.  If my memory serves me well I&#8217;d say it burned down a few hundred years ago and the building are abotu 20 years old (replicas).  There was a time lapse.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2197 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2202 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2205 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Now we are visiting a temple.  I have to say, the Korean temples have sadly started to melt together in my memory but this one really stands alone.  It has two towers inside and they were beautiful.  One of the towers was being restored and we got to climb the scaffolding and peak at the man working.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2208 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>This is one amazing picture!  That new lens has really been paying off!</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2210 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this amazing?</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2215 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>Here is the man working on the tower.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2219 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2222 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2226 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2227 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2228 w=400 h= float=center]</p>
<p>That&#8217;s me and my man!</p>
<p>Well, on another note, we are doing very well.  I have been grinding away on my applications and Chad has been AMAZING through it all.  He deserves lot&#8217;s of high-fives.</p>
<p>I hope that everyone is doing well.  This is out last Christmas in Korea.  We are pretty excited &#8211; there are a lot of wonderful things coming up!</p>
<p>Oh, and Molly will be here in 2 weeks then we get to go to the Philippines!  Lucky dogs!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Kate and I went on a field trip with our school to the Uljin Nuclear Facility &#8211; more on that later but we also went up to this small pagoda overlooking the ocean.  I took this set up photos and uploaded it to <a href="http://photosynth.net" target="_blank">photosynth.net</a> &#8211; a microsoft photo project and here&#8217;s how it turned out!!  Not amazing but it&#8217;s still cool.  I&#8217;ll start uploading the photos for the better one I took in Seoul from Seoul Tower soon.  It takes a long time for the software to do it&#8217;s thing but it does some really cool stuff.  Enjoy.</p>
<address>Note: This may require you download the Silverlight plugin.  It&#8217;s quick and easy &#8211; just a plugin like quicktime or windows media.</address>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Sorry for the long break between posts.  We&#8217;ve been having trouble accessing Blogger from work, and we&#8217;ve been busy in the evenings with school activities.  Hence the lack of posts, but we will be better in the coming weeks.  We&#8217;re working on some changes for the site.  Better hosting for photos of our travels, new page layout and design, new hosting service.  We will also hopefully start using WordPress in the near future so we&#8217;ll have more flexibility and control.  (and because I really want to learn WordPress :o)  So look forward to those changes in the next few weeks.</div>
<div></div>
<div>General Update:</div>
<div>Boredom has set in as we are finishing up the final days of the fall semester.  Geundeok had it&#8217;s end of the year tests a week and half ago, so all of our afterschool classes and camps have been canceled since then.  So, we come to work and sit on the computer all day&#8230;   This week we taught one class together for the parents of the afterschool students, and I taught 3 of my 4 classes with Korean teachers, Kate hasn&#8217;t taught any.  So we sit &#8211; dream about our vacation in a few weeks, plan for it, lookup grad schools, dream of coming home and going to said grad schools, catch up on emails, do online crossword puzzles, and then repeat.  Not so exciting at school, but we&#8217;ve had some interesting distractions at night.   Wednesday afternoon/evening we had our final Volleyball game against the other Guendeok district schools.  This was a lot of fun and we got to leave our computer posts a few hours early.  Thursday we had a Korean speech and song festival which was.. well interesting.   Another post will be up soon with more details on that exciting evening.   So, that&#8217;s about it as of late.  We&#8217;re gearing up for a ski trip with our school next Tuesday-Wednesday, and for Christmas we&#8217;re having a number of the other Weigooks (foreigners) over to our apartment for a pot-luck and dirty Santa gift exchange.  Should be fun!  </div>
<div></div>
<div>More soon!</div>

Teacher.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This picture was taken right after all of the Education Big Fish came through in their suits.  We kind of think that they are the biggest reason that this Fair happened.  To show the Big Guys (And Gals) what the schools are doing.  It seemed like a lot of money to pour into 10 seconds of bowing and handshakes per school.  At least there were fun things for the kids to do at the fair like making soap and mini-books and little <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">creatures</span> made of bark and twigs. </div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was also this,</p>

It was fun and we got some funny pictures of Chad.  A newspaper even took pictures and interviewed him about his experience.  According to Teacher Kim they wanted to talk to Chad about his experience in this contraption because he looks happy and Koreans don&#8217;t show emotion.  Yes, that is what she said. </p>

<p>Well, that all the new on Lake <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Woebegon</span>.  More to come.  As usual I am behind with posting.  We have been preoccupied with planning our winter vacation. All of our computer time has been sucked into that.  We do <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">have</span> our tickets booked now, so thats <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">exciting</span>! </p>
<p>I just made muffins.  The muffin tin was too big for our <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">petite</span> oven so I had to double up the paper cups and bake the muffins on a cookie sheet.  We&#8217;ll see how they turn out.  Oh, that reminds me.  . .</p>
<p>Last Sunday Chad made peanut butter cookies.  They were fabulous, I just polished the last one off yesterday.  We brought a large portion of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">cookies</span> to school thinking we would share them with the teachers <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">during</span> our 10:40 snack time/teachers meeting.  We put them out on the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">communal</span> table and they were gone before school started at 9:20.  Amazing.  I love the teachers we work with.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>

<p>We celebrated with the kids all month long during our Camps on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Here are some pictures from the 2nd grade camp last week. Tonight we are having a few people over for Halloween and we&#8217;re baking an Apple PIE with our new oven!!!</p>
<p>We made pumpkin masks, skeletons, watched Winnie the Pooh Halloween, Charlie Brown, Disney, Sang songs about pumpkins and witches, and ran around like mummies! It was all quite exciting. Here&#8217;s a few pictures from the camps.

<p>Two weeks ago <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Samcheok</span> hosted the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SAFEM</span> Exposition.  It happens every few years, no one was able to tell me how often.  This week long event is the biggest safety fair in all of Asia.  <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Samcheok</span> was flooded with people from all over to visit booths about safety.  Last Thursday our Camp was cancelled and we got to accompany the 5<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">th</span> and 6<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">th</span> graders on a field trip to the Expo.</p>

A lot of what we encountered was very familiar.  I do not know  the specifics but I do know that the US was the designated country to help South Korea get on its feet after the Korean War.  Considering how familiar these tanks were I assume that they might be one of the few American things we have encountered here.</p>
<p>Anyone know more about this?</p>

Check out his fancy bus driving outfit!</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This brings me to an interesting and off topic point.  I think that through out this blog you have probably picked up on the fact that the social system here is very different from in the States.  AKA WOMEN ARE NOT SEEN AS EQUAL.  Another piece of the social differences is the hierarchy of position.  So, for example, this bus driver is supposed to treat me, a teacher, with more respect than he would treat a fellow bus driver.  I am not supposed to treat him with the same respect as I do the principle.  This has been incredibly difficult (possibly even more difficult than knowing that they are always going to go to Chad about anything and not me).  I grew up with my parents pounding into me to treat everyone equally.  Everyone should receive the same amount of respect.  The fact that it is offensive to some that I treat someone &#8220;bellow&#8221; me with the same respect I give to someone &#8220;above&#8221; me has been incredibly difficult.  This part of their culture is incredibly difficult to adjust because in my opinion it is <span style="font-style: italic;">WRONG</span>!</p>
<p>Well, we are here to promote change, to help bring Korea into the Western World.  How much of that can I do without offending everyone?  A thin, wavering line.  All I know is that I will not stop respecting people.  i just need to figure out how to respect without offending others.  Wow.</p>
<p>I just had to get that out there.  One of the reasons I know I will never make Korea my permanent home.</p>
<p>Happy Sunday!  We are off to play <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Badminton</span>!</div>

<div>For sports day Chad and I were assigned to stamp the kids 1st, 2<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">nd</span></span>, or 3rd when they cross the finish line.  Then we made them sit down in their respective line and wait to be escorted back to the holding area for the children.  It was a fun way to get LOTS of high-fives in.</p>
<p><span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">During</span> one <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">of</span> my stamp and squat sessions teacher Kim (our English speaking guide) ran over to me, dragged me over to a line-up of mothers with their children and stuck me in a mother place. She told me &#8220;You are his mother,&#8221; and ran off. No direction, just go with the Korean flow, Kate. The first kid I was mother to was not happy to be stuck with the tall white woman as his Mom, the second held my hand and my third child was incredibly cold and then told me &#8220;Good job!&#8221; in <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">English</span> when I caught the ball on our turn.</div>

<div>After I acted as Sports Day <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Guardian</span> to a few children Chad got to play Mom too.

<div>Our VP is the little guys in the blue baseball cap.  He is pouring beer for everyone at lunch.  The lunch that <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">preceded</span> the noontime beer drinking consisted of lavish <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">sea things</span>. . .Raw?  Not sure.</p>
<p>Have fun?  We did!</p>

<div>Chad and I are having a lesson planning day. We have finished our first week of plans which gives me the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">opportunity</span> to share a few <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">anecdotes</span> from the last 30 minutes of my life which may shed light on the world Chad and I are living in.</div>
<div>After lunch we always head back to the teachers room where everyone has coffee or (REALLY <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SUGARY</span>) <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">vitamin</span> juice. This little relaxation before our afternoon starts usually includes an informal English lesson for the teachers. Today we talked about the words &#8220;tomb, grave and waterfall.&#8221; As were were sitting and chatting the Principal walked in (everyone rise. . .at least sometimes. . .not sure on when. . just do it) and said &#8220;<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Chaed</span>&#8221; and presented Chad with a huge bag of loaves of bread. He then presented me with a huge bag of rice (which looks like a h<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">uge</span> bag of <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">mozzarella</span> cheese). Korean Thanksgiving gifts. So we now have enough <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">carbs</span> for the next month! </div>
<div>Yesterday when we were leaving school (when I say &#8220;we&#8221; I mean EVERYONE at school, together) everyone was crowded around the little garden near the parking lot. They were carrying on and giggling. The principal started <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">beckoning</span> at us (beckoning here is like the gesture for &#8220;shew&#8221; like swatting a fly). We confusedly approached and saw what all of the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">commotion</span> was. One small watermelon in the school garden. We just ate it <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">during</span> the coffee break. </div>
<div>My final coffee break <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">anecdote</span> involves attire. Today I sucked it up and decided to not be scared to wear a knee length skirt (to the top of my knee). I was a little nervous this <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">morning</span> but I haven&#8217;t been given any real <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">reason</span> to be worried. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">During</span> our coffee break the nurse said &#8220;<span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">Skirt</span> beautiful&#8221; to me. Then she spoke in Korean to our main English contact about what she was trying to say. Teacher <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Jang</span> looked at me and said &#8220;You should dress.&#8221; he was trying to <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">reiterate</span> that the Nurse liked my skirt. It just came out wrong and was <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">particularly</span> funny because of my paranoia. Teacher <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">Jang</span> is taking come throat <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">meds</span> so we are <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">blaming</span> that. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<p>
<div>Finally, as I walked from break central back up to the English village a crew of first graders ran up to me yelling &#8220;Teacher, Teacher!&#8221; We are used commotion in the hallways when we walk through but these kids proceeded to drag me to the backdoor of the school. I was then <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">presented</span> with a box. As the top of the box was lifted open I was greeted by a dead bird. Okay, fine. Kids are kids. I went to get the first grade teacher to figure out how to dispose of this little guy. She came, spoke with the kids and left. I figured she was <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23">going</span> to get a bag or something. i waited a few minuted and nothing happened. So, I peaked back around the corner to her desk and the First Grade teacher was back at her computer. I went back to the outside door of the school and saw the children had left with the box and were playing with the bird like a baby doll. </div>
<p>
<div>Like I said, 30 minutes of a day. </div>
<div>Now I need to go and cut out shapes for name tags. </div>
<div>Happy Friday!</div>
