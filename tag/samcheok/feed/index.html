				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the Samcheok Office of Education hosted an English Festival for all of the Elementary and Middle Schools.  This 3 day event was mainly a competition consisting of speeches, skits, and quiz games.  Our school participated in all of the events and Kate and I judged a few of the events as well.  All in all it was a fun few days and a nice break from being at school :).  Here are some pictures from the event.  For the full album visit <a title="English Festival" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/english-festival/">this page</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I&#8217;m also in the process of uploading videos from the event.  They&#8217;ll be up soon.</span> UPDATE: They&#8217;re up now!</p>
<p>As always &#8211; click the image to see a larger version.</p>
<p>[singlepic id=2160 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>This is MinJae &#8211; one of the students in our skit.  He&#8217;s amazing&#8230; and has the best smile around!</p>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2162 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>Our 2nd grader, Hanbit, reading an English story about his mom.  Be sure to check out the <a title="Hanbit" href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/55/">video of this</a>&#8230; adorable.</p>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2164 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>This is Miguem.  Kate wrote about her speech a few weeks ago <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/its-paying-off/">here</a>. She did a great job!  Again &#8211; a video <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">will be up soon.</span> is <a title="Migeum" href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/57/">here</a>!</p>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2165 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>These little guys were from another school and they sang and danced to a song called &#8220;Do the Elephant!&#8221;.  Pretty amazing!!  Check out the <a title="Animal Song" href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/spicyfishy/videos/58/">video </a><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">soon</span>!</p>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2167 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>We did &#8220;Who&#8217;s on First&#8221; for our skit.  It was pretty great &#8211; at least we thought so.  They did a great job and I think they understood it which was great.  This is Who, What, and I don&#8217;t know &#8211; the players.</p>
<div>
<p>[singlepic id=2168 w=400 h=266 float=center]</p>
<p>This is Jaeook and Minjae &#8211; the fans going to the baseball game.  They&#8217;re both really sweet boys in the 6th grade and they did a great job in the skit!</p>
<p>Throughout all of this &#8211; Kate was more nervous than any of the students.  But they all did a great job and Kate made it out alright too <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been hoarding a bunch of new pictures for the past few weeks &#8211; waiting for a good time to edit them down and post them.  So here we are.  Be sure to check the captions on the pictures for more information about them.  We&#8217;ve had some great adventures lately and these hopefully capture a bit of them.  I&#8217;ve been trigger happy lately ending up with 5 and 6 hundred photos from some trips, so this is definitely a sampling &#8211; but it&#8217;s really all the pictures anyone would ever actually want to see. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   I&#8217;ll be posting some more photosynths of places around Korea soon too.  (That&#8217;s really where the photo counts go up like crazy! )</p>
<p>Enjoy and please leave a comment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When we returned from our trip to America I brought back my favorite kind of sketch book.    When it comes to drawing I am not a Moleskin fanatic.  My best quick sketches come from square sketch books &#8211; they can be rectangular or square.  Last month I set a goal to do at least two quick sketches every week.  I have actually stuck to it.  My sketch book has tagged along on every weekend adventure and it has gotten some attention.</div>
<div>I am doing this for many reasons.  First of all, when I lived in Cortona I was graded on the sketch book I kept.  The result of that exercise was countless memories from my time there.  Despite the fact that I express myself visually, I am oblivious to the visual world.  Unless I sit down and spend time with it it is lost on me.  The other main reason I am doing this is to regain my drawing skills.  I used to be good at drawing at I&#8217;ve lost that.  Painting is an easy way to ignore drawing.  Drawing is a fundamental.  Without that structure any piece of art, realistic or abstract, is weak.</div>
<div>To hold myself accountable I will be sharing a few of these sketches on my blog.  I hope you enjoy them!</div>
<p><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/nextgen/kate-sketches/sept28sketchiiicombo.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5391299544626401186" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 247px; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/StG-Xxsuj6I/AAAAAAAABL8/E_Nste_OvwQ/s400/sept28sketchi%26iicombo.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="400" height="247" /></a></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;">Sept 28, 2009, Samcheok-si, South Korea</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>As you can see, this image is of two sketch merged together.  Chad and I climbed the big hill in Samcheok one night to have a picnic. As he snapped pictures I drew the ship yard on the East Sea/Sea of Japan.  I did a couple of quick sketches of the shipyard then settled into the one on the left.  For better context I did the other sketch &#8211; I wanted to remember the contrast of the shipyard and the rolling coast.  If you let your eyes wander to the left you can get a little bit of the vast feeling from the ocean. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span>While I was drawing there was a Korean man with me in the pagoda.  He sat for a long time then got up and did a bunch of exercises for a good ten minutes.  As he was preparing to go he came up to me and told me that he liked my camera case.  My camera case is an old gift card bag from Anthropologie.  He was pretty sweet, didn&#8217;t speak a word of English.  We said good-bye and then Chad arrived for the picnic. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;">September 5, 2009, Samcheok-si. South Korea, Bea</span><span style="font-size:small;">ch</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">This is the view south up the coast towards Donghae.  We go to Donghae for sandwich sized wheat bread.  More than once we have seen huge ships going in and out of that port &#8211; once we even saw a submarine!  This particular day was one of relaxing in the sand.  We were surrounded by Koreans playing in the water.  There was a group of Koreans there from a tour bus.  They were very enamored with us and one even asked for a picture together.  A a little while after he came back because he wasn&#8217;t happy with the first picture.  I held out my hand and said, &#8220;Mon won!&#8221; which means &#8220;Ten dollars!&#8221;  Luckily, he laughed. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">The next two sketches are from a bit further down the beach in the little cove you can see in the sketch above.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />

</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I</span><span style="font-size:small;"> drew this on the day of our last cookout on the beach.  Every other weekend or so we all go to the beach to grill.  In this little grilling cove we are surrounded by rocks, the ocean, a bit of sand, barbed wire, and a military lookout point complete with a gun rest.  These lookouts are scattered every kilometer or so along the coast.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I didn&#8217;t finish this sketch but I like it.  Gareth and Chad were waiting for the grill to heat up while I sketched.  As I started this drawing everyone else arrived.  I love drawing figures.  I have a long way to go to get back into shape but I still enjoy it. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">Well, that is all you get to see from September.  I have started using some graphite in October so next month will be very exciting!</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;"><br />

<div style="text-align: left;">*This was also posted on my <a href="http://www.katekorroch.blogspot.com">art blog</a>.  Sorry for any doubles!</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:small;">I hope everyone is well.  We miss you all and can&#8217;t wait to get back to the States next spring.  (Today marks 300 days until we get married!!!!)</span></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today Kate and I took a walk out past the Expo center, took a random turn up a small road and ended up walking through some amazing farms in the hills.  We see small farms and fields everywhere but these were really beautiful.  The weather was great so there were a lot of people out working.  Here are a few pictures I took while we were out.  I did a bit of doctoring in Aperture on some of them.  Tomorrow we&#8217;re planning on going down to the ocean to take some pictures and so Kate can draw.  The waves are huge right now due to the typhoon off of the coast of Japan.   If I get any good shots I&#8217;ll post them too.  It&#8217;s our negative 300 day anniversary today <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   (300 days until our wedding!).  We&#8217;re  going out to dinner with the Lithuanians tonight but we&#8217;ll celebrate with lunch near the ocean tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having some fun with photoshop lately so I thought I&#8217;d share what I&#8217;ve been up to.  These are just a few photos I&#8217;ve tinkered with or put together with photoshop.  Nothing too special but some interesting shots.</p>
<p>Click the images to see a larger version&#8230;</p>
<p>1.   This was taken on Samcheok beach back in June or July.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/beach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-876  aligncenter" title="beach" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/beach-300x131.jpg" alt="beach" width="300" height="131" /></a> <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama.jpg"></a></p>
<p>2.  I took the panorama a few weeks ago from Samcheok Mountain.  It&#8217;s facing toward the sea port and you can see the bright lights of the squid boats out in the water.  That&#8217;s not exaggerated.. they really are that bright.  (click this image once.. then again to see an even larger version.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-875    aligncenter" title="samcheok-shipyard-panorama" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-shipyard-panorama-300x98.jpg" alt="samcheok-shipyard-panorama" width="300" height="98" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">3. I love this picture of Kate!  It&#8217;s pretty cheesy I know and the vingetting is really strong .. but that&#8217;s what I was trying to learn how to do .. hah so enjoy that beautiful smile <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/katebeach.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-874  aligncenter" title="katebeach" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/katebeach-200x300.jpg" alt="katebeach" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">4. Jump!  This was taken last semester during a traditional korean festival day at school.  This is a popular traditional Korean game.  Just some simple dodge and burn to accentuate the action.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">5. This is my first attempt at an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging" target="_blank">HDR photo</a> &#8211; (High Dynamic Range).  It was taken from the mountain in Samcheok (of Samcheok) and wasn&#8217;t intended to be an HDR photo.  I was taking some shots for a panorama but I think it turned out alright.  It&#8217;s my first attempt so don&#8217;t judge it too harshly.  My dodge and burn attempts are reallllly spotty but that&#8217;s not what I was trying to learn how to do.  It was also a really gloomy/dark day &#8211; so it was a tough day to shoot pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-hdr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-872    aligncenter" title="samcheok-hdr" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/albums/WP/samcheok-hdr-300x200.jpg" alt="samcheok-hdr" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll be posting some pictures from a hike we did the other day at Hwansangul soon.  We&#8217;re hosting our first Couch surfers tonight &#8211; so I&#8217;m going to go be social with them.  Some nice Lithuanian girls who are in Seoul for the Semester.</p>

<p>If you look closely through the trees you can see a temple.  I have only stopped by once.  Hopefully one of our biking adventures will take us there soon.</p>

<p>It took me a while to figure out my biking legs.  Honestly, I am still afraid of running into things like trees and dumpsters.</p>

<p>This is another shot of the EXPO ground.  The Batman looking building is an indoor cave!  Pretty fun.</p>

<p>Here is the set from <em>Brazil</em>, I mean the cement plant that you can hear from kilometers away.  Isn&#8217;t it lovely?  It&#8217;s the one structure in Samcheok I have been inspired to draw.  Well, I haven&#8217;t actually done the drawing part yet.</p>

<p>This little bike path/avenue was lined with blooming cherry blossoms trees only a few days ago.  To the right are the river and cement plant.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/index.php?album=090412 New Bikes&amp;image=090412 New Bikes24.jpg"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb" title="090412 New Bikes24" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/zp-core/i.php?a=090412 New Bikes&amp;i=090412 New Bikes24.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=" alt="090412 New Bikes24" /></a></p>
<p>Okay, the only reason I am typing this blog post (just kidding) is to share my petal pedals!  My pedals are petals!  I might not get over this for a while.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/index.php?album=090412 New Bikes&amp;image=090412 New Bikes25.jpg"><img class="ZenphotoPress_thumb" title="090412 New Bikes25" src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos/zp-core/i.php?a=090412 New Bikes&amp;i=090412 New Bikes25.jpg&amp;w=400&amp;h=" alt="090412 New Bikes25" /></a></p>
<p>Look at the magnificent array of bikes on the bike stand outside of out apartment!  They all have words like &#8220;style&#8221; and &#8220;elegance&#8221; printed on them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now, Folks.  Thanks for reading.  You should look in our video section to see the drive from our school to Samcheok.  Gorgeous cherry blossoms.  Take care and happy (belated) Easter!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">HAPPY NEW YEAR!</span></span></div>
<p>Top 10 From 2008</p>
<p>I was inspired by my friend <a href="http://magical-newyork.blogspot.com/2008/12/top-ten.html">m&#8217;s blog</a> to do a Top 10 From 2008 list.  My list is basically the top things I can remember that I am proud of or happy I did or just something that makes 2008 a one-of-a-kind year.  In no particular order:</p>
<p>1. Chicago, Silver and Gold &#8211; I made some wonderful new friends this year, rekindled old friendships, and I got to spend tons of time with my best friends from IU. I don&#8217;t think anyone could ask for much more. Oh wait, they can, and I will. An amazing family. Ooops, I&#8217;ve got it!</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://katekorroch.blogspot.com/2008/05/explore-wild-opening.html">Explore the Wild </a>- I created the concept and organized, advertised, and curated a show for three young artists in Chicago (<a href="http://www.caseysearles.blogspot.com/">Casey Searles</a>, Andrew Heber, and <a href="http://www.katekorroch.com./">Kate Korrcoh</a>).  The show was a success and I loved doing every part of it.  I not only had work I was excited to share but I also got to do what I am really good at and see wonderful results.  Not to mention I got tons of amazing support from friends from many different parts of my life, that was very special.</p>
<p>3. As a self-employed artist/artist&#8217;s assistant I paid my rent and bills for a year on time with no financial assistance.</p>
<p>4. Two Birds, One Stone &#8211; I have a job that has amazing <span style="font-style: italic;">health care</span> AND the job is in a <span style="font-style: italic;">f</span><span style="font-style: italic;">oreign country</span>.  Along those lines, one of the birds, I am living in a culture that challenges me to a new extent.  This is not my beloved Italy where I could communicate well in the language, eat all of their food and where all people where equal no matter their sex occupation.  I wanted a challenge and I got one.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jenslekmanmusic">Jens Lekman</a> hugged me (because we said &#8220;Bloomington&#8221; which makes it even better)!</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SVs-MslfgfI/AAAAAAAAA5E/uqYQaTuYt4c/s1600-h/IMG_5395.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SVs-MslfgfI/AAAAAAAAA5E/uqYQaTuYt4c/s400/IMG_5395.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285886975497175538" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" >Kate, Jens, Chad</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">(Okay, not the best picture of him but it&#8217;s my proof!)</span><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:85%;" ></p>
<p></span></div>
<p>6.  I now eat meat and I can no longer drink regular coffee.  Two major lifestyle changes for me.</p>
<p>7. Megabus &#8211; Made it possible for me to survive a long distance relationship spread over the vast Midwest.  One trip I got from Chicago to Saint Paul for one dollar!</p>
<p>8.  I started doing yoga (and liked it this time) and I ran 6 miles a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>9. Last April Chad and I flew to Virginia to spend a long weekend to see my sister, Molly, in <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</span>.  My Mom&#8217;s Aunt Liz and Uncle Nick and my Grandparents were all in town for the show.  We had one special morning with everyone, then Grandma and Grandpa took off and we spent some amazing days with Aunt Liz and Uncle Nick.  We did lots of fun site seeing (a large portion on the water in various boats), ate wonderful food, had wonderful debates and more laughs than I can count.  Uncle Nick has been battling cancer and passed away a few days ago.  I am incredibly thankful that we got that time with him.  We had a blast, a perfect way to remember him.  Not to mention Chad had a chance to get to know this incredible man who is extremely important to my family.</p>
<p>10. Colorado &#8211; Chad&#8217;s parents and I drove for two days out to visit Chad.  I got to ask lots of questions and hear lots of amazing stories! We arrived to find Chad changed from an Audio Recording Dude to a Mountaineer!  We had a great time hiking and looking around Aspen.   I ended up staying a little bit longer than planned to climb my first (and only at this point) 14er, <a href="http://14ers.com/routemain.php?route=lapl2&amp;peak=La%20Plata%20Peak">La Plata</a>!  That was a a great trip.</p>
<p>BONUS: The man bellow.  I couldn&#8217;t be happier.  I am one lucky girl.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SVtCmI0twTI/AAAAAAAAA5M/yf-76diOUjk/s1600-h/web.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SVtCmI0twTI/AAAAAAAAA5M/yf-76diOUjk/s400/web.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285891810620457266" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">La Plata, July 2008</span></span></div>
<p>It was a good year.  Thank you for being part of my 2008.</p>
<p>I hope you have a fabulous 2009!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few Fridays ago (why always Friday?) we took part in the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Samcheok</span> Lifelong Learning Fair.  Thursday evening we set the booth up (about 30 people were put on that task).  On Friday we showed up to be the token English teachers! </p>

<div style="text-align: left;">This booth was packed with things the students have done.  It is also peppered with English Village themed things like a poster of the English teachers!  <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Guendoek</span> is one of the few school that has an English Village so it puts a lot into showing off the facilities. </p>

<div style="text-align: left;">Above is our good friend Mark in his booth.  <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Definitely</span> the coolest booth!  It was all Halloween themed and there were even costumes to try on!</div>

I know that the tug of war rope looks like a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">pretzel</span> and that the game is very old and a big tradition. </p>

Teacher.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This picture was taken right after all of the Education Big Fish came through in their suits.  We kind of think that they are the biggest reason that this Fair happened.  To show the Big Guys (And Gals) what the schools are doing.  It seemed like a lot of money to pour into 10 seconds of bowing and handshakes per school.  At least there were fun things for the kids to do at the fair like making soap and mini-books and little <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">creatures</span> made of bark and twigs. </div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was also this,</p>

It was fun and we got some funny pictures of Chad.  A newspaper even took pictures and interviewed him about his experience.  According to Teacher Kim they wanted to talk to Chad about his experience in this contraption because he looks happy and Koreans don&#8217;t show emotion.  Yes, that is what she said. </p>

<p>Well, that all the new on Lake <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Woebegon</span>.  More to come.  As usual I am behind with posting.  We have been preoccupied with planning our winter vacation. All of our computer time has been sucked into that.  We do <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">have</span> our tickets booked now, so thats <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">exciting</span>! </p>
<p>I just made muffins.  The muffin tin was too big for our <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">petite</span> oven so I had to double up the paper cups and bake the muffins on a cookie sheet.  We&#8217;ll see how they turn out.  Oh, that reminds me.  . .</p>
<p>Last Sunday Chad made peanut butter cookies.  They were fabulous, I just polished the last one off yesterday.  We brought a large portion of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">cookies</span> to school thinking we would share them with the teachers <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">during</span> our 10:40 snack time/teachers meeting.  We put them out on the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">communal</span> table and they were gone before school started at 9:20.  Amazing.  I love the teachers we work with.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>

<p>Two weeks ago <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Samcheok</span> hosted the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SAFEM</span> Exposition.  It happens every few years, no one was able to tell me how often.  This week long event is the biggest safety fair in all of Asia.  <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Samcheok</span> was flooded with people from all over to visit booths about safety.  Last Thursday our Camp was cancelled and we got to accompany the 5<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">th</span> and 6<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">th</span> graders on a field trip to the Expo.</p>

A lot of what we encountered was very familiar.  I do not know  the specifics but I do know that the US was the designated country to help South Korea get on its feet after the Korean War.  Considering how familiar these tanks were I assume that they might be one of the few American things we have encountered here.</p>
<p>Anyone know more about this?</p>

Check out his fancy bus driving outfit!</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This brings me to an interesting and off topic point.  I think that through out this blog you have probably picked up on the fact that the social system here is very different from in the States.  AKA WOMEN ARE NOT SEEN AS EQUAL.  Another piece of the social differences is the hierarchy of position.  So, for example, this bus driver is supposed to treat me, a teacher, with more respect than he would treat a fellow bus driver.  I am not supposed to treat him with the same respect as I do the principle.  This has been incredibly difficult (possibly even more difficult than knowing that they are always going to go to Chad about anything and not me).  I grew up with my parents pounding into me to treat everyone equally.  Everyone should receive the same amount of respect.  The fact that it is offensive to some that I treat someone &#8220;bellow&#8221; me with the same respect I give to someone &#8220;above&#8221; me has been incredibly difficult.  This part of their culture is incredibly difficult to adjust because in my opinion it is <span style="font-style: italic;">WRONG</span>!</p>
<p>Well, we are here to promote change, to help bring Korea into the Western World.  How much of that can I do without offending everyone?  A thin, wavering line.  All I know is that I will not stop respecting people.  i just need to figure out how to respect without offending others.  Wow.</p>
<p>I just had to get that out there.  One of the reasons I know I will never make Korea my permanent home.</p>
<p>Happy Sunday!  We are off to play <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Badminton</span>!</div>
