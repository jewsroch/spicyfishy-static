				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve been home for over 2 months now and time is flying by.  Our wedding day is quickly approaching and the details are starting to come together! (We think!)  Right now, Kate is in Virginia with her family spending countless hours bringing the wedding together, applying for scholarships, and enjoying time with her family.  I&#8217;m here in Kokomo with my parents working on my parts of the wedding, training for a sprint triathlon (eeek), and applying for jobs in Chicago!  It&#8217;s an exciting time!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to forego the usual blogger apology for lack of recent updates and I&#8217;m not going to promise anything for the near future because quite frankly we&#8217;re both preoccupied with other things that have to take precedence right now.  But Rest assured that once we are settled in Chicago and have a bit more time to devote to this we&#8217;ll be uploading many more photos and videos from the end of our travels and the past few months.  We&#8217;re on a pretty amazing ride right now and can&#8217;t wait to share it with you!  So, please excuse the hiatus&#8230;</p>
<p>For now, here are a few pictures from the recent months&#8230;</p>
<p>For more detailed descriptions view on flickr &#8211; <a title="Random Photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury/sets/72157624159915971/">click here!</a></p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kate and I were stranded in Paris because of the Icelandic Volcano.  We stayed there for 3 extra days then took bus to Barcelona and on to Madrid where we got a flight home.  It was an adventure and it was ridiculous (and annoying).  Now we&#8217;re fighting battles with the travel insurance company which is very frustrating but in the end it was a nice bonus to get to see spain a bit!</p>
<p>Enjoy the Pictures,  We&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see some of you at the wedding in a few weeks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all,<br />
We are home from the Philippines &#8211; have been for about a week now, but we&#8217;re just getting around to editing the pictures/videos and getting some posts up to the site.  We&#8217;re weeding out the not so great pictures and will be uploading them as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Things might look a bit different with photos from now on because we&#8217;re starting to use Flickr to host them.  This shouldn&#8217;t change much in terms of how you find or see the pictures except that it should be faster (most of the time) and much less of a hassle on our end.  (That&#8217;s the hope at least&#8230;)  Assuming all goes well with the photos from the trip we&#8217;ll gradually move all of the older photos over to the flickr account as well.   So look forward to that, although you shouldn&#8217;t really be able to tell of a difference if I do my job correctly <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of our last month in Korea <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />   We&#8217;re not sure exactly what day we will leave Korea but it will be sometime around March 1st and we&#8217;ll definitely be out of the apartment by February 27th or so.  We will keep you posted on the details when we find out.  As it stands right now we&#8217;re still planning on traveling to China and Southeast Asia for about 6 weeks after we leave Korea &#8230;. in a month.  (Wow, we better start planning!!)</p>
<p>Last week we finished teaching!  That&#8217;s right, a full month before the end of our contract and after coming back from 3 weeks off, we taught one week and now are finished teaching!  Crazy!  We were supposed to also teach this week but for some reason all classes were cancelled, so we&#8217;re off the hook &#8211; although we do have to go to school for a few hours every morning.   Next week is graduation, so we&#8217;ll have some &#8220;normal&#8221; days then but still not teaching.  After the 10th (Graduation) we&#8217;re not sure what we&#8217;ll be up to or if we&#8217;ll have to come in to work at all.  That time is typically another vacation/transition time before the Spring semester starts.  So we&#8217;ll see!  We will definitely miss this job and how good they are to us.  (and there&#8217;s really no excuse now for us to not get the pictures up soon&#8230;.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="flickr-image alignnone" title="lost1" rel="flickr-mgr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hippie/51231450/" target="_blank"><img class="flickr-large" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/24/51231450_7dfed115cd.jpg" alt="lost1" /></a><br />

<p>We&#8217;ve been talking a lot about what this year and the coming years will bring and the only thing that we know is that nothing is certain.  Where will we live?  What will we be doing?  Questions like these are constantly in our conversations and thoughts now-a-days.  It&#8217;s a strange feeling to have such an unusually clean slate on which to re-start.  It&#8217;s simultaneously terrifying and exciting! &#8211; but every day we move closer it shifts more to the later.  It&#8217;s going to be great!  So, I know it&#8217;s a little late, but we&#8217;re welcoming in 2010 and holding on tight, it&#8217;s going to be a pretty crazy (and wonderful) ride!</p>

Lots of driving, packing, and stress&#8230; Kate spent some time back in Virginia, then a week in Michigan with her family. I left Aspen on the 15th and drove to Michigan in two days &#8211; with a stop at both grandparents houses. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  We spent a day and a half with Kate&#8217;s family, and celebrated her Grandmother&#8217;s birthday. Kate repacked for the 3rd time and finally got down to just 4 bags &#8211; the max. Then we drove down to Kokomo so I could pack. While there (for 4 days) we went to Indy to see Christa and Michael. Below is a picture from our dinner in Broadripple. Michael was sharing his wisdom on Korean Cuisine and told us a story which inspired this blog&#8230; or at least its title. He and his friend went to a Korean restaurant for dinner one night and as is traditional in Korean meals, the main dish was accompanied by lots of small dishes <img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240209852264599138" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SLj3GMi7zmI/AAAAAAAAAMk/DRGJLaHs52w/s200/IMG_4114.JPG" border="0" />which everyone shares. This can be anything from raw crab (in its shell) covered with hot spicy pepper sauce to slabs of tofu and radishes. Everyone reaches around the table with their chopsticks snatching up whatever they&#8217;d like to eat. At this particular restaurant there were this small chunks of something&#8230; (a usual sight at a korean meal <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  and they tried it. It was very spicy and kind of fish-like. They liked it a lot and the next time they went out to a Korean restaurant they didn&#8217;t get the mystery food. This &#8220;Spicy Fish&#8221; was intriguing to them and they really wanted to be able to order it again so they asked the waitress if she knew what it was&#8230; describing it in as much detail as they could. She then replied&#8230; &#8220;Ohhh Spicy Fishy!!&#8221; and brought some out Michael and his friend. Hence<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SLjznGlwihI/AAAAAAAAAMU/KDgnWbt_tZU/s1600-h/DSCN0964.JPG"></a> the name&#8230; (It&#8217;s funnier when Michael tells the story &#8211; and I&#8217;m not sure if I got the story even right&#8230;) nonetheless &#8211; it&#8217;s a great title and we&#8217;re excited to keep posting about our adventures, both with cuisine, and this amazing country.<br /><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240216268955829634" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SLj87slVxYI/AAAAAAAAANI/rX3dM-lTU7o/s400/DSCN0964.JPG" border="0" /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SLj6sOllt1I/AAAAAAAAAM4/cQveoOuoywQ/s1600-h/DSCN0977.JPG"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240213804182517586" style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SLj6sOllt1I/AAAAAAAAAM4/cQveoOuoywQ/s200/DSCN0977.JPG" border="0" /></a>After we spent a few days in Indiana we went up to Chicago with my parents and stayed with Julie and Zane. We went out to a Thai restaurant with a bunch of friends and had a great last night in the US. The next day we drove out to Ohare and took off for the other side of the world&#8230; EEP!
