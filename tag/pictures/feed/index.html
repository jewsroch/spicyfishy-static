				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve been home for over 2 months now and time is flying by.  Our wedding day is quickly approaching and the details are starting to come together! (We think!)  Right now, Kate is in Virginia with her family spending countless hours bringing the wedding together, applying for scholarships, and enjoying time with her family.  I&#8217;m here in Kokomo with my parents working on my parts of the wedding, training for a sprint triathlon (eeek), and applying for jobs in Chicago!  It&#8217;s an exciting time!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to forego the usual blogger apology for lack of recent updates and I&#8217;m not going to promise anything for the near future because quite frankly we&#8217;re both preoccupied with other things that have to take precedence right now.  But Rest assured that once we are settled in Chicago and have a bit more time to devote to this we&#8217;ll be uploading many more photos and videos from the end of our travels and the past few months.  We&#8217;re on a pretty amazing ride right now and can&#8217;t wait to share it with you!  So, please excuse the hiatus&#8230;</p>
<p>For now, here are a few pictures from the recent months&#8230;</p>
<p>For more detailed descriptions view on flickr &#8211; <a title="Random Photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury/sets/72157624159915971/">click here!</a></p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kate and I were stranded in Paris because of the Icelandic Volcano.  We stayed there for 3 extra days then took bus to Barcelona and on to Madrid where we got a flight home.  It was an adventure and it was ridiculous (and annoying).  Now we&#8217;re fighting battles with the travel insurance company which is very frustrating but in the end it was a nice bonus to get to see spain a bit!</p>
<p>Enjoy the Pictures,  We&#8217;ll be back soon!</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see some of you at the wedding in a few weeks!</p>
<p>-Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello all!<br />
After a brief outage, I think the site should be up and running again. Our host was having some issues yesterday.  We&#8217;re in the middle of our spring trip home and are currently in Shanghai, China.  Right now we&#8217;re working on an organic farm outside of Shanghai for about 10 days.  We work for 6 hours a day doing farm work or administrative help (with their website and art projects) and in exchange we get a place to stay and 3 meals a day!  It&#8217;s amazing!  We&#8217;ll post more about that when we have more time but just wanted to update quickly with some pictures from the first 2 weeks of our trip!  We&#8217;re going to put a hold on posting the rest of our Philippines trip pictures, sorry but we didn&#8217;t have a chance to get them uploaded before we sent our computers home.  But don&#8217;t worry we&#8217;ll upload them soon enough.</p>
<p>A quick update of what we&#8217;ve been up to&#8230;<br />
We frantically left our apartment on the 26th of February after being told we had to leave a day earlier because the new teachers were coming!  We stayed with some friends in Samcheok then left for Daegu for a Temple Stay.  We stayed at Haeinsa Temple for one night and had a great experience with the monks there.  Next we headed to Busan (southern Korea City) to visit two friends from IU who just moved there to start teaching English! After a few days there we headed up to Seoul for a day on the high-speed train then flew to Beijing!</p>
<p>I developed a nasty cold while in Korea so we took it pretty slow the first few days in Beijing and stayed in a great hostel just north of the forbidden City.  We visited the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, A few parks in Beijing, The Great Wall, and saw a Peking Opera.  The last two nights we stayed with some lovely Couch Surfers named Prometheus and Lucy and went out for a great Hot Pot!  Beijing was really a lot of fun and we definitely will go back at some point.  (Kate found a number of galleries that have great residency programs!)</p>
<p>Next we took the high-speed train to Shanghai where we are now.  As I said above, we&#8217;re working at the <a href="http://www.biofarm.cn">Biofarm</a> in shanghai and having a great time.  This morning we transplanted seedlings and now we&#8217;re designing some icons for their new website.  (What a vacation!)  We&#8217;re enjoying getting to know the farmers and staff and having a more intimate Chinese experience &#8211; and we&#8217;re learning a thing or two about organic farming too!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a few photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadjewsbury">flickr </a>so take a look at this gallery for a sample of what we&#8217;ve been up to!  Check back here as we upload more photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Hello Everyone!  Chad has been doing an amazing job arranging all of our pictures.  I thought I could contribute and regale you with the tales of our 36 hours in Manila!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 12:56 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4331211833_a692460d2e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2760/4331211833_a692460d2e_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 12:56 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Chad mentioned in <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/winter-vacation-part-1-seoul/">his last post</a>, Molly, Chad and I all left Incheon the same day.  One slight snafue in our planning &#8211; Molly took off at 9:30 AM, we took off at 9:30 PM.  Little did Chad and I know that we would fall in love with the Incheon airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we had our MacDonald&#8217;s breakfast we headed upstairs to find a cozy place to catch up on reading/sleep/picture taking.  Incheon has huge bean bags all over upstairs.  We saw one open up and pretty much sprinted to claim it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Chad took lots of pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">I read lots of D.H. Lawerence&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Love">Women in Love</a></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 01:01 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/4331212563_0ea315f1f9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/4331212563_0ea315f1f9_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 01:01 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I love this picture.  Notice there is only one man who is standing still.  Can you find him?  Ill give you one hint &#8211; he&#8217;s Korean!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 01:35 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4331952718_d206466704_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4331952718_d206466704_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 01:35 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Sleepy heads!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 9, 2010 01:13 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4331951690_3f4798384b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4331951690_3f4798384b_m.jpg" alt="January 9, 2010 01:13 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Hangin&#8217; with D.H.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, we landed in Manila at 12:30 AM.  It was beautiful and balmy and the airport made the Indianapolis airport look like the biggest airport in the world!  We got into a cab and had an experience.  The cab driver was appalled at the location of our hostel and spent the entirety of our drive telling us we shouldn&#8217;t go there.  This was between wrong turns and police checkpoints!  Wow.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we finally arrived at the hostel it was very nice and the owner was incredibly welcoming.  It was very clean and we had great roommates.  The location was slightly dodgy but we&#8217;re here to tell the tale!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next morning we walked around Rizal Park.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:30 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4331214707_4cb019a879_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4331214707_4cb019a879_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:30 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These kids got super excited when Chad was taking pictures.  They all lined up and jumped around for him!  They are much more active picture takers than our students!  I wish I had my camera out to take picture of Chad taking their pictures &#8211; it was pretty cute.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:33 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4331214993_39a0a7c2d3_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4331214993_39a0a7c2d3_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:33 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is me, Ana (German), and Blanca (Columbian living in China).  They were our roommates in Manila and we spent the day with them.  They were quite lovely ladies!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:42 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4331216215_921c9c4049_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/4331216215_921c9c4049_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:42 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 02:45 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4331954874_824d6ba460_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4331954874_824d6ba460_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 02:45 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were ice cream trucks everywhere and they all constantly played the same ding-dong tune!  After about 3 minutes of wandering around the park we all had it stuck in our heads.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:09 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4331957366_c00514ab0a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4331957366_c00514ab0a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:09 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:12 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4331968986_5145c33d97_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/4331968986_5145c33d97_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:12 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">A view of Chad at work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:15 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4331969404_b1f585f89b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4331969404_b1f585f89b_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:15 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">A view of Chad&#8217;s work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the park and some lunch we headed to a fort commemorating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Rizal">Jose Rizal</a> (every main street in Manila is Rizal Avenue).  Rizal was a huge nationalist/martyr in the Philippines in the late 1800&#8242;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:18 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4331232041_bc6002d68a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4331232041_bc6002d68a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:18 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Below is a view from the top of the fort wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:29 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4331972060_93006b564a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4331972060_93006b564a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:29 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Manila metropolis.  Vastly different from what we left in Seoul.  I had no idea how different it was going to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:31 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4331285453_4b3a097a2a_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4331285453_4b3a097a2a_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:31 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">Gazing at . . . . ?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:33 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4332024000_c87b9f9ba9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4332024000_c87b9f9ba9_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:33 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 05:39 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4331287449_00e442aef0_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4331287449_00e442aef0_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 05:39 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the end of the day we were very tired.  Instead of fighting to get onto the subway system we decided to hop into a jeepney.  They are bus-jeeps that people jump into for a quick, cheap ride.  Hold on tight!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 10, 2010 06:17 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4332026378_b275553747_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4332026378_b275553747_m.jpg" alt="January 10, 2010 06:17 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next day, right before we headed to the airport, Chad and I decided to check out the Chinese cemetery that was right outside of our hostel.  It vaguely reminded me of the tombs I visited in Cortona 4 years ago.  In the Philippines people really go all out for their deceased loved ones.  Some of the tombs have air conditioning, running water, full fridges, etc.  I think we should have just stayed in one of those!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 11, 2010 01:23 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4332026920_41f4a13b36_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4332026920_41f4a13b36_m.jpg" alt="January 11, 2010 01:23 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">We wanted to take this little guy home but he was too big for our backpacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; "><a title="January 11, 2010 01:24 PM" rel="floatbox" href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4332027078_17b1a91bc5_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4332027078_17b1a91bc5_m.jpg" alt="January 11, 2010 01:24 PM" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Manila was a very interesting and educational experience.  We saw a ton of poverty and many people with a much different standard of living then we are used to seeing as the norm.  Chad mentioned some of it in <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/el-nido-update/">a post he made</a> while we were traveling.  I  felt like a naive voyeur the entire time we were in Manila.  It was very sobering and prompted a lot of discussion for the trip.  Who are we to decide what is comfortable and not comfortable?  Who are we to live in a three bedroom apartment with plumbing?  Do they want that?  How do we help?  Do they want help?  Maybe they are perfectly and happy and just because it wouldn&#8217;t make us happy doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t even happier than we are.  There is a fine line and  seeing it is a huge challenge.  I hope that Chad and I remember how that felt and that we manage to do the right thing and not ignore it.  We both want to get back into volunteering when we get home and maybe even while we are traveling.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One a lighter note, we are in the midst of arranging our trip for the spring.  Right now we plan to be in China for about a month then we&#8217;ll head through Vietnam to Cambodia.  After that we plan to fly from Bangkok to Paris.  We plan to be home in mid to late April.  We&#8217;ll let you know as things firm up!  We are incredibly excited and each time we sit down to plan we just talk about how crazy it is that we get to see all these amazing places!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well, we only have one computer now and I need to get a few things accomplished before I hand it over to Chad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope everyone is doing well and staying warm!  Anyone buried in the snow?</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I wrote a longer post a little bit ago but it got deleted <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Sorry&#8230; here is an abridged version -</p>
<p>Kate and I are in Puerto Princesa right now sitting in an internet cafe surrounded by World of Warcraft Gamers.  This morning we were in Manila  &#8211; which was an interesting experience.  Very grimy gritty city &#8211; more third worldy than we expected but it was definitely worth a day or two.  It Put everything in perspective for sure.  We will post more about that later.</p>
<p>Kate&#8217;s sister Molly was in Korea for the last 2 weeks visiting us.  We had a great time with her!! She came to school with us.. toured around Samcheok and went to Seoul for a few days before she flew home and we flew to the Philippines.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Kate and I had to wait in the airport for 12 hours for our flight (after Molly flew out in the morning) .  Gave me some time to practice with my Camera <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left; ">We had school pictures a couple of months ago and our teachers all took these two pictures together.  We also took individual photos, which we never saw, but we were given these a few days later &#8211; just getting around to posting them now, sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">The first is a standard posed picture &#8211; (from the roof of the school) with all of the Geundeok teachers and staff.  This is everybody <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[singlepic id=2229 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
<p style="text-align: left;">The second picture is a new-age-awesomeness picture envisioned by the artiste photographers&#8230; If we were a band, we would be awesome&#8230; but we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re elementary school teachers &#8211; so it&#8217;s just goofy.  But that&#8217;s Korea!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">[singlepic id=2230 w=400 h= float=]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of these people are really amazing.  We&#8217;ve become great friends with a number of them and will miss them greatly when leave in a few months.  One advantage of being at such a small school is that it&#8217;s really like an extended family.  I know every one of these people pretty well and some of them are really our best friends in Korea.  That&#8217;s much less possible at a school with 80 teachers that is departmentalized and divided.   I&#8217;d list the names and positions of everyone in the picture but it would probably be silly.  Our closest friends are the woman on the far left (black sweater tan skirt) &#8211; She&#8217;s the 5th grade teacher, teacher Kim Young-mi and is a year older than us.  She came this year from Taebaek and has been a great friend!  Can&#8217;t imagine the past year without her great sense of humor and fantastic English.  The woman in the front with the White Jacket (younger woman) is our official Co-teacher, Son Eun-Jin.  She&#8217;s amazing!  Such a fantastic friend and always willing to help us when we have problems.  (And she&#8217;s the hardest working person in our school <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) In front of Kate (to the left a bit) in all black is Teacher Kim Suk-jin.  She was our first friend here in Korea and really helped us a lot our first semester here.  She was in the U.S. last summer studying English and is now teaching most of our classes with us (long story).  She&#8217;s great and we will miss her a lot.  Hopefully some of these ladies will come to our wedding!!  There are a number of other teachers I&#8217;d love to tell you about and surely will sometime soon, but for now that&#8217;s it <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Just wanted post these pictures while I was thinking of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All the best&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kate and I are enjoying homemade apple pie and whip cream tonight.  Thanks KATE!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-Chad</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been hoarding a bunch of new pictures for the past few weeks &#8211; waiting for a good time to edit them down and post them.  So here we are.  Be sure to check the captions on the pictures for more information about them.  We&#8217;ve had some great adventures lately and these hopefully capture a bit of them.  I&#8217;ve been trigger happy lately ending up with 5 and 6 hundred photos from some trips, so this is definitely a sampling &#8211; but it&#8217;s really all the pictures anyone would ever actually want to see. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   I&#8217;ll be posting some more photosynths of places around Korea soon too.  (That&#8217;s really where the photo counts go up like crazy! )</p>
<p>Enjoy and please leave a comment!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today Kate and I took a walk out past the Expo center, took a random turn up a small road and ended up walking through some amazing farms in the hills.  We see small farms and fields everywhere but these were really beautiful.  The weather was great so there were a lot of people out working.  Here are a few pictures I took while we were out.  I did a bit of doctoring in Aperture on some of them.  Tomorrow we&#8217;re planning on going down to the ocean to take some pictures and so Kate can draw.  The waves are huge right now due to the typhoon off of the coast of Japan.   If I get any good shots I&#8217;ll post them too.  It&#8217;s our negative 300 day anniversary today <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   (300 days until our wedding!).  We&#8217;re  going out to dinner with the Lithuanians tonight but we&#8217;ll celebrate with lunch near the ocean tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enjoy -</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Kate and I went on a field trip with our school to the Uljin Nuclear Facility &#8211; more on that later but we also went up to this small pagoda overlooking the ocean.  I took this set up photos and uploaded it to <a href="http://photosynth.net" target="_blank">photosynth.net</a> &#8211; a microsoft photo project and here&#8217;s how it turned out!!  Not amazing but it&#8217;s still cool.  I&#8217;ll start uploading the photos for the better one I took in Seoul from Seoul Tower soon.  It takes a long time for the software to do it&#8217;s thing but it does some really cool stuff.  Enjoy.</p>
<address>Note: This may require you download the Silverlight plugin.  It&#8217;s quick and easy &#8211; just a plugin like quicktime or windows media.</address>

<p>[singlepic id=897 w=450 h=90 mode=watermark  float=center]</p>
<p>A picture taken just the other day out by the ocean.  We rode our bikes down to the fishing village and took some fun pictures.  A little editing in photoshop.  I really love this one :) </p>
<p>[singlepic id=898 w=450 h=90  float=center]</p>
<p>An old picture from our trip to Penang &#8211; be sure to look for the tiny plant growing on top of the doorway!  Love this picture too..  </p>
<p>[singlepic id=899 w=450 h=90 mode=watermark float=center]</p>
<p>Firedancers on Koh Tao. Amazing!</p>
<p>[singlepic id=900 w=450 h=90 float=center]</p>
<p>The Cameron Highlands in Malaysia &#8211; so beautiful!</p>
<p>[singlepic id=901 w=450 h=90 float=center]</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur from the KL tower.  Over saturated and tweaked in Photoshop.  </p>
<p>[singlepic id=902 w=450 h=90 mode=watermark float=center]</p>
<p>Kate kissing a cow at a school picnic last week.  We went to our school bus driver&#8217;s farm/restaurant.  It was a lot of fun &#8211; and Kate loved these cows :) </p>
<p>[singlepic id=903 w=450 h=90 mode=watermark float=center]</p>
<p>I took this photo at sunset near the expo center in Samcheok.  This is actually the reflection in the river which gives it a cool texture &#8211; it&#8217;s flipped as well.  </p>
<p>[singlepic id=904 w=450 h=90 mode=watermark float=center]</p>
<p>Two of our 5th graders during children&#8217;s day celebrations at school.  The one in front is one of our favorites.. he&#8217;s really sweet.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thats all for now&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be posting more pictures very soon and hopefully an update or two on what we&#8217;ve been up do.  (Mainly school activities)  We&#8217;re heading to Japan in a few weeks so that should be fun! </p>
<p>More soon,</p>
