				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the Samcheok Office of Education hosted an English Festival for all of the Elementary and Middle Schools.  This 3 day event was mainly a competition consisting of speeches, skits, and quiz games.  Our school participated in all of the events and Kate and I judged a few of the events as well.  All in all it was a fun few days and a nice break from being at school :).  Here are some pictures from the event.  For the full album visit <a title="English Festival" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/english-festival/">this page</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chad and I have had a crazy schedule recently.  We had a huge demo class at our school that required weeks of preparation and renovation and then we quickly ran to Seoul for me to take the GRE.  After less than 12 hours home we boarded a bus to tour the DMZ.  We got home last night.  In about two weeks the Board of Education is hosting an English festival.  We received a paper today that one of our students, Jin Mi Guem (gin like gin and tonic, me like me, guem like chewing gum), wrote to read at the festival.  She is in 4th grade.  Her English is great and she is one of our favorite students.  Surprise!</p>
<p>The reason I want to share this with you is that reading this essay  proved to us that the little things we do are paying off.  Not soon after we arrived here we realized that we were not in Korea to make sure everyone can respond to &#8220;How are you?&#8221; twenty different ways.  We are here as diplomats of the English language and western culture.  Our goals became much bigger that the difference in the pronunciation of &#8216;rice&#8217; and &#8216;lice.&#8217;   Every time we reach out to those kids and accept them for who they are and for what they already know, they will become more and more comfortable with us and our way of life.  Every time Chad treats me as an equal or says that he cooked dinner he is showing the students that  women and men are equal.  It&#8217;s a much bigger goal than we had originally anticipated but much more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Mi Guem&#8217;s essay proved to us that our efforts are working.  The entire essay can be read bellow but the parts that pertain to my blog post are in boldface.</p>

<p><span>좋은 시간 되세요. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.</span></p>
<p><strong>STOP</strong></p>
<p>I think I could write an entire book about Mi Geum&#8217;s essay.  I hope that every foreign teacher with goals similar to ours gets to see how his or her work effected their students.</p>
<p>A note, most of you have probably picked up on the name thing here.  How you address someone is incredibly important.  We have been making a point to always be respectful to everyone &#8211; not just those above us. I love the Mi Guem thinks Kate and Chad are our last names.   Chad made a post recently, <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/annoying-our-students/">Annoying Our Students</a>, in it we are teasing them about not understanding when they ask if Chad and I are a couple.  In the first video I say that Mi Guem is my friend, she spazzes out and says &#8220;No, you are my teacher!&#8221;  It&#8217;s cute, especially after reading this essay.</p>
<p>- &#8211; -</p>
<p>On another note, look forward to more pictures!  Chad sold our two old digital cameras and got an amazing new lense!  He had some great pictures of our DMZ trip but some are now gone, that&#8217;s for another blog post.</p>
<p>One more final tidbit from the lived of Chad and Kate, I took the GRE on Saturday.  My last name, Korroch, is smack bad between Kim and Lee.  I had to raise my hand and ask that the protor read the directions in English!</p>
<p>Chad is out getting a haircut and curry ingrediants.  He is wonderful.  :)  I&#8217;m about to start nursing my cold with some Ugly Betty and EMERGEN-C.</p>
<p>OH, MY SISTER MOLLY IS COMING HERE FOR TWO WEEKS IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>Happy Hump Day!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Kate &amp; Chad</p>

I don&#8217;t really know much about it.  I know that the tug of war rope looks like a <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">pretzel</span> and that the game is very old and a big tradition. </p>

Teacher.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This picture was taken right after all of the Education Big Fish came through in their suits.  We kind of think that they are the biggest reason that this Fair happened.  To show the Big Guys (And Gals) what the schools are doing.  It seemed like a lot of money to pour into 10 seconds of bowing and handshakes per school.  At least there were fun things for the kids to do at the fair like making soap and mini-books and little <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">creatures</span> made of bark and twigs. </div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was also this,</p>

It was fun and we got some funny pictures of Chad.  A newspaper even took pictures and interviewed him about his experience.  According to Teacher Kim they wanted to talk to Chad about his experience in this contraption because he looks happy and Koreans don&#8217;t show emotion.  Yes, that is what she said. </p>

It was fun and we actually did some of the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">activities</span> with her. </p>

<p>Well, that all the new on Lake <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Woebegon</span>.  More to come.  As usual I am behind with posting.  We have been preoccupied with planning our winter vacation. All of our computer time has been sucked into that.  We do <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">have</span> our tickets booked now, so thats <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">exciting</span>! </p>
<p>I just made muffins.  The muffin tin was too big for our <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">petite</span> oven so I had to double up the paper cups and bake the muffins on a cookie sheet.  We&#8217;ll see how they turn out.  Oh, that reminds me.  . .</p>
<p>Last Sunday Chad made peanut butter cookies.  They were fabulous, I just polished the last one off yesterday.  We brought a large portion of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">cookies</span> to school thinking we would share them with the teachers <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">during</span> our 10:40 snack time/teachers meeting.  We put them out on the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">communal</span> table and they were gone before school started at 9:20.  Amazing.  I love the teachers we work with.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>
