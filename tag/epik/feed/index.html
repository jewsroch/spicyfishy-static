				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the Samcheok Office of Education hosted an English Festival for all of the Elementary and Middle Schools.  This 3 day event was mainly a competition consisting of speeches, skits, and quiz games.  Our school participated in all of the events and Kate and I judged a few of the events as well.  All in all it was a fun few days and a nice break from being at school :).  Here are some pictures from the event.  For the full album visit <a title="English Festival" href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/photos-2/korea/english-festival/">this page</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago we got an email from our coordinator Chance that read,  &#8220;Some of you may have heard about a planned &#8220;Korean Performance&#8221; that is to be put on by us EPIK teachers. If you haven&#8217;t heard, this is being planned by the Samcheok Office for December 18th. I don&#8217;t want to influence any judgements, so I&#8217;ll try to keep my language neutral and unopinionated here. They want us to put on a Korean performance, singing songs or giving speeches in Korean.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long string of emails between the other EPIK teachers followed&#8230; complaining about how we signed up to teach English and not dance and sing like English monkeys and about how if we don&#8217;t do a performance they might take away our banana privileges (as English monkeys) and how we wish we actually were paid in bananas because they&#8217;re probably worth more than the won right now&#8230; etc..   All said, no one was pleased with this idea.</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days, reports came in from other EPIK teachers about their schools asking (or telling) them to perform.  Two Fridays ago Teacher Kim came to our house after school to give us our subpoena to the dreaded performance.  She understood how awkward it was for us but said the Principal would be very sad if we didn&#8217;t do a performance.. (so, we had to&#8230;)  We talked with some other teachers and came up with a plan to sing only the choruses of a few Korean pop hits and dance like fools.  We put it together last Monday, rehearsed it on Wednesday and had the performance on Thursday evening.   Here are two videos from the evening&#8230;  try not to laugh too much.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="437" height="370" id="viddler_75a5fb1a"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/75a5fb1a/"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/75a5fb1a/" width="437" height="370" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" name="viddler_75a5fb1a"></embed></object></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" id="viddler_93867123" height="370" width="437"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/93867123/"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/93867123/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" name="viddler_93867123" height="370" width="437"></embed></object><br />All in all the evening turned out to be just fine.  Everyone who performed was nervous and everyone messed up a bit, so it was entertaining.  Although we were in a nice hotel conference room, with round tables and glassware (with forks/knives!!),  and the entire administration and other school principles were there&#8230;  it was fairly laid back and everyone understood how hard it was for the EPIK teachers to do this.  So, our humorous rendition of k-pop songs was greeted warmly.  (Thank goodness!!)    And hey, we each got 20,000 won in gift certificates and two boxes of traditional Korean cookies for our performance!!</p>
<p>We all were dreading it, but it turned out well and now I know the words to a few choruses of Korean songs.  It&#8217;s strange coming from singing classical music in foreign languages everyday (in college) to this&#8230;  but I&#8217;d like to think everyone could hear all the training over the terrible sound system <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>All for now&#8230;<br />-Chad</p>
<p>Here are some links to the songs we covered in our mix&#8230;<br /><a href="http://kr.youtube.com/watch?v=B-pcGW0rT1g">&#8220;Arirang&#8221; (Traditional Korean Song.)</a><br /><a href="http://kr.youtube.com/watch?v=HR_NXHlEQvc&amp;feature=related">&#8220;La La La&#8221; (SG Wannabe)</a><br /><a href="http://kr.youtube.com/watch?v=yz9LQy0rmq0">&#8220;Nobody&#8221; (Wondergirls)</a>  &#8212; (the youngest girl in this group is 16.. oldest 20.  whoa!)<br /><a href="http://kr.youtube.com/watch?v=6WM8pi7EIdc">&#8220;Ochada&#8221; (Brown Eyed Girls)</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Thursday I left school at 2:30 with my Vice-principle to go to the Samcheok Office of Education.  Kate had left earlier that day at around 1:30 for a volleyball game against some other local school teachers.  The volleyball game happens about once a month and it&#8217;s usually a lot of fun.  Picture 30 Korean teachers playing volleyball (surprisingly well) in a cold gymnasium with the office staff and other teachers (mostly the women) watching and cheering for their teem.  It is always followed by a full out Korean meal experience, which we&#8217;ve grown to enjoy, with our school.  Naturally I was a bit disappointed that I didn&#8217;t get to go play volleyball, no &#8211; scratch that &#8211; I was pretty darn upset that I didn&#8217;t get to.  Not only did I not get to go and Kate did, but I had to go sit in a meeting at the office of education for some reason that I had yet to learn.</p>
<p>The drive to the meeting took abnormally long.  Maybe Kyo Ka Sanseinim (VP) was driving extra slow because we had left a half hour early for a meeting that was at most 15 minutes away.  Maybe it was his odd choice of music &#8211; a strange mix of teenybopper pop and 80s garage band&#8230; all in Korean except for one song with a chorus that went something like &#8220;Ooh I really want you, I really want you.&#8221;  Or maybe he just loves awkwardness and driving around in silence.  More likely, he&#8217;s an upper middle aged man who drives slow and it only felt longer than it actually was.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Office of Education &#8211; a stately new building situated near the Chungsol Apartments (high rises) on top of the hill in Samcheok.  I had been to the building before so this wasn&#8217;t new, but it always means an adventure&#8230;  Never quite sure who will be there, what the meeting will be for, or how long it will take.<br />We walked in and up the stairs to the Education offices.  I was told to wait in the hallway as VP went in to take care of some sort of business before the meeting started.  Meandering through the hallways I was struck by the long sterile hallways of white and grey.  All the doors were closed &#8211; presumably to conserve heat (as each room is individually heated).   I couldn&#8217;t help but equate the space to the bureaucracy and the false perception of efficiency that were the hallmarks of the education system in Korea.  Everything here was clean and eerily tidy out here, but behind the doors. . .</p>
<p>Other Weigooks (foreigners) started to come up the stars with their administrators or co-teachers and we all exchanged glances of confusion and sympathy.  It&#8217;s always amusing to see other foreigners at these meetings because we&#8217;re almost always in the same boat &#8211; we were told of the meeting either 5 minutes before or if we&#8217;re lucky the day before, none of us know what the meeting is really about, we&#8217;re all hoping there isn&#8217;t a dinner afterwards because it&#8217;s always just kind of awkward with the supervisors, we&#8217;re hoping the meeting will be short, and we hope we can understand at least part of it.  We all entered the usual conference style room to see the tables and chairs arranged in a U pattern to facilitate conversation and debate.  It looked like a council meeting in some small town in the states &#8211; except for the banners. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SS1u1Ud8EdI/AAAAAAAAAdo/FoKRkxWJuNk/s1600-h/IMG_4514.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iDC60m48snk/SS1u1Ud8EdI/AAAAAAAAAdo/FoKRkxWJuNk/s320/IMG_4514.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272992601027121618" border="0" /></a>  Koreans are obsessed with banners.  It&#8217;s really quite odd&#8230;  Every event or meeting or activity is accented by a bright colorful banner.  This meeting, of course, was no exception.  A large banner across the front of the room displayed some Korean writing and the date and time of our &#8220;summit&#8221;, if you will.  The head of EPIK in Samcheok was at his desk at the top of the U and would oversee the meeting (with his own banner/poster next to him &#8211; in case we couldn&#8217;t see the big one behind him :).  After everyone was seated in their appropriate seat behind their colorful name plate, the meeting began.  The opening ceremony was short for this one (luckily).  We stood for the national anthem, did the usual introductions and listened to Korean for a while.   William, one of the foreigners in the TaLK program (Teaching and Learning in Korea) translated parts of the meeting into English (usually this does not happen and we are left to decipher on our own&#8230;).</p>
<p>Now we know what the meeting is about &#8211; a forum to discuss our feelings about any issues/problems we&#8217;ve had or ideas we might have about how the EPIK program could be improved.  Our schools would each present how they have decided to structure their English programs and then we would each speak about our experience so far and any suggestions we may have.  We start the presentations and an hour and 15 minutes later (of solid Korean) we start the discussion.</p>
<p>Here is what I find so odd about the Education system here.  The foreign teachers are told to come to this meeting with all of our bosses, with free treats and drinks, and fancy banners, and nameplates &#8211; and then we&#8217;re expected to tell them everything that we don&#8217;t like about our experience so far.               ?                 Although all of us have some problems with our schools or problems with our apartments or problems with some students etc&#8230; we&#8217;re not going to say these things in this kind of meeting.  So, instead, we all go around the circle and say the same thing &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m happy here. My school has been very gracious and I really appreciate it.  It has been hard to adapt to some parts of the culture but overall it&#8217;s been a great experience so far.  The kids are wonderful and I enjoy teaching.&#8221;  Some people throw in a few legitimate suggestions like offering more substantial Korean language lessons to teachers, or teaching more sentence structure to the older students, but none of us really express what we are all thinking &#8211; Stop making us go to pointless meetings like this where we usually don&#8217;t understand anything &#8211; Teach your Korean teachers more English&#8230; it&#8217;s the only way this is really going to work in the long run &#8211; Standardize the experience between schools for foreign teachers by developing (or buying) a curriculum and teaching plan to be followed in after school and co-taught classes and by enforcing more structured standards for living and working environments &#8211; Require that the administrators in charge of English education have at least some grasp of the English Language and an even better understanding of Western Culture.  All of these are legitimate concerns that should be dealt with but they won&#8217;t ever get heard in meetings like these.  It&#8217;s frustrating more than anything.  This byproduct of the Confucianism that is still a part of everything here (although less in the younger generations) is so backwards from the way most of us here think.  We are do-ers, thinkers, debaters, and for the most part tolerant people.  We like to be challenged and made to accept other views or ideas.  We like to get things right by working with everyone involved to perfect the system.  This is of course at the core of what the administrators are trying to do, but until they understand how foreigners react to these meetings and how much more could get done with smaller groups and conversations from the bottom up, not just from the bottom to the top, the system will remain as it is.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#8217;t to say a lot of great steps aren&#8217;t being taken.  This fall Korea increased funding for foreign language education in elementary schools by some amazing amount and started requiring that there be one or two full time teachers at almost every school (hence why we are here now).  In recent years they&#8217;ve started teaching English to first and second graders (although I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s mandatory) which is crucial and already obviously working.  But at the same time, more teachers are here and more problems have arisen &#8211; like schools who have never had a foreign teacher not knowing how to deal with them and leaving basically on their own, or teachers having to travel an hour or more to get to their school everyday because there isn&#8217;t enough housing in the small town.  Without all the pomp of these meetings maybe they could get down to fixing some of these issues too.</p>
<p>With all that said- Kate and I are truly happy with our school.  The teachers are all amazing and open to trying to talk to us, the administrators are all friendly and really want to make sure we are comfortable, the students are amazing and inspiring, our commute is never more than 20 minutes, we are usually told when things change in the schedule or meetings/events are upcoming, and most of all we&#8217;re treated like part of the Geundeok Family.  We are extremely lucky.  Many others here have not been as fortunate as we have and we are thankful for our school.  I just hope that the system can be fixed even just a little bit so that more people can have the experience we have had.  After all, we&#8217;re here for the students and the happier we are the better teachers we&#8217;ll be.  Kate always says &#8211; &#8220;If we can leave here in a year with the kids feeling more comfortable and excited about meeting foreigners and learning English, then we were successful.&#8221;  That part is easy if we are happy to come to work everyday.</p>

Teacher.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;">This picture was taken right after all of the Education Big Fish came through in their suits.  We kind of think that they are the biggest reason that this Fair happened.  To show the Big Guys (And Gals) what the schools are doing.  It seemed like a lot of money to pour into 10 seconds of bowing and handshakes per school.  At least there were fun things for the kids to do at the fair like making soap and mini-books and little <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">creatures</span> made of bark and twigs. </div>
<p>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was also this,</p>

It was fun and we got some funny pictures of Chad.  A newspaper even took pictures and interviewed him about his experience.  According to Teacher Kim they wanted to talk to Chad about his experience in this contraption because he looks happy and Koreans don&#8217;t show emotion.  Yes, that is what she said. </p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SSkTzNBZErI/AAAAAAAAArw/4OSmacM_76g/s1600-h/IMG_5318.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SSkTzNBZErI/AAAAAAAAArw/4OSmacM_76g/s400/IMG_5318.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271766609203630770" border="0" /></a><br />After Chad and I had checked out all of the booths Teacher Kim arrived at the Fair and had us go around with her.  It was fun and we actually did some of the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">activities</span> with her. </p>

<p>Well, that all the new on Lake <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Woebegon</span>.  More to come.  As usual I am behind with posting.  We have been preoccupied with planning our winter vacation. All of our computer time has been sucked into that.  We do <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">have</span> our tickets booked now, so thats <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">exciting</span>! </p>
<p>I just made muffins.  The muffin tin was too big for our <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">petite</span> oven so I had to double up the paper cups and bake the muffins on a cookie sheet.  We&#8217;ll see how they turn out.  Oh, that reminds me.  . .</p>
<p>Last Sunday Chad made peanut butter cookies.  They were fabulous, I just polished the last one off yesterday.  We brought a large portion of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">cookies</span> to school thinking we would share them with the teachers <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">during</span> our 10:40 snack time/teachers meeting.  We put them out on the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">communal</span> table and they were gone before school started at 9:20.  Amazing.  I love the teachers we work with.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Have a great week!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this at my Friday school Kongcheun Elementary 공촌초교. Kate is sitting next to me after an unexpected trip here from her Friday school Jangho Elementary 장호초교. How did we arrive at this pleasant surprise? The story, I will tell&#8230;</p>
<p>This morning early, at about 8:20, Kate and I were picked up by Stephane (pronounced &#8211; [Stef-awn] &#8211; A 40 something single Korean man who enjoys going to singles night at his christian church. His nick-name is Stephane from the time he spent working as a missionary in a French speaking country. We drive the 25 minutes to my school Kongcheun listening to Korean Christian ballads and not really talking much at all. This is all part of the Friday Routine (if you can call it that). I get out at my school and walk up to find many extra cars in the parking lot. (No longer are we on a normal schedule &#8211; from here on out it gets more and more random). I walk in to find Principals from other schools, VP&#8217;s from other schools and other high up administrators from the ministry of education in Samcheok. This was somewhat expected because today I was teaching in a Demonstration Co-teaching class. We practiced for this last week so that students were well rehearsed. I walked around a met some of the &#8220;powerful people&#8221; and then we practiced a bit before the class at 10:10. The back of our classroom filled up with observers and we taught a most perfectly rehearsed class. Even the Korean teacher, who doesn&#8217;t speak much English, said most of her English directions without having to look at her script. We were all pleased. Then they started to move desks in for some bigger meeting, so I left and went back downstairs. One of the supervisors for Elementary Ed in Samcheok (who has introduced himself to me now, 3 &#8211; 5 times, he drinks a lot and already smelled of soju at 9am this morning) came into the office and asked me to come upstairs to discuss our lesson. I obliged and went to sit in on an hour meeting (ALL IN KOREAN) about my co-teacher&#8217;s and my class. It was very exciting. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  Then I waited another hour doing nothing but chatting with Kate on gmail about how confused we both were, then ate lunch &#8211; a sprawling traditional Korean meal (made by the school cafeteria) including raw octopus, wheh (raw fish), snails, Noodle soup with beef (all I ate) and of course &#8211; rice and kimchi. Everyone ate and was merry for 15 minutes and then left. Seriously, it was that fast.<br />After everyone left, I sat and started to write this post. Then I hear &#8220;Chad? &#8221; Whoa it&#8217;s Kate!!</p>
<p>Kate&#8217;s day was less surprising in the morning. No large crowds of important people or raw Octopus. But, because her principal was at MY school, they had a very relaxed day and decided to out to eat and go fishing. Fishing however is MAN&#8217;s Activity, so she was banished to the joy of Kongcheun. Stephane wanted Kate to come fishing, but no one else did <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  So they all went out to eat, then drove her to my school and said &#8220;Go find your boyfriend&#8221;. Then, &#8220;Hitting Bong&#8221; (seriously, that&#8217;s his nick name &#8211; his last name is bong) came in and told us we are going to dinner with him and his principal. Then we find out it&#8217;s the whole school in celebration of the morning. Now everyone is cleaning up the school, and we are sitting here bored and slightly confused. This is the tale of pretty much every Friday&#8230; It&#8217;s always an Adventure.</p>
<p>If anything else crazy happens we&#8217;ll be sure to update this post. But for now, wish us luck!</p>

<p> Today was not only our first days teaching but alsp our first days at our Friday schools!  Big Day!  My school has about 30 students and I am only teaching 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th.  My biggest class had 6 students.  Amazing. </p>
<p>The third grade class was wonderful, 5 little girls who were amazing at English speaking.  After class they dragged me to the floor with them to play a dice game (pictured above).  You throw a dice up and grab others from the floor while the dice is in mid air.  There are levels of each throwing and grabbing seqence. . . They are really good at it and I am not.  It was nice to just play with the students.  At our other school there are many more students (a whopping 120) so there is less playtime with the teachers.  I loved it.  I had friends at lunch. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Friends that do things like count to three and chant &#8220;Teacher is beautiful.&#8221;  I need to train Chad to do that.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>After the 3rd grade girl crew I had the 4th grade boys.  They requested English names and due to their giggly manner I found it appropriate to name them after my Dad and his brothers.  Tom, Bob, Dave and Jim.  There was a problem with my Dad&#8217;s name. . . &#8220;Bob&#8221; sounds like &#8220;Bap&#8221; which means rice in Korean.  So, the kid felt like he was the staple food group instead of a strapping young Korroch.  Robert sounded too much like robot so we settled on John.  I call him John Bob. </p>
<p>Finally I got semi-ditched by my co-teacher for my last class.  I am training the 5th grade on Peter Piper.  They actually liked it.  I hope to get lots of tounge twisters into  them. </p>
<p>Happy Weekend!</p>

<div>Chad and I are having a lesson planning day. We have finished our first week of plans which gives me the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">opportunity</span> to share a few <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">anecdotes</span> from the last 30 minutes of my life which may shed light on the world Chad and I are living in.</div>
<div>After lunch we always head back to the teachers room where everyone has coffee or (REALLY <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SUGARY</span>) <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">vitamin</span> juice. This little relaxation before our afternoon starts usually includes an informal English lesson for the teachers. Today we talked about the words &#8220;tomb, grave and waterfall.&#8221; As were were sitting and chatting the Principal walked in (everyone rise. . .at least sometimes. . .not sure on when. . just do it) and said &#8220;<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Chaed</span>&#8221; and presented Chad with a huge bag of loaves of bread. He then presented me with a huge bag of rice (which looks like a h<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">uge</span> bag of <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">mozzarella</span> cheese). Korean Thanksgiving gifts. So we now have enough <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">carbs</span> for the next month! </div>
<div>Yesterday when we were leaving school (when I say &#8220;we&#8221; I mean EVERYONE at school, together) everyone was crowded around the little garden near the parking lot. They were carrying on and giggling. The principal started <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">beckoning</span> at us (beckoning here is like the gesture for &#8220;shew&#8221; like swatting a fly). We confusedly approached and saw what all of the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">commotion</span> was. One small watermelon in the school garden. We just ate it <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">during</span> the coffee break. </div>
<div>My final coffee break <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">anecdote</span> involves attire. Today I sucked it up and decided to not be scared to wear a knee length skirt (to the top of my knee). I was a little nervous this <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">morning</span> but I haven&#8217;t been given any real <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">reason</span> to be worried. <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">During</span> our coffee break the nurse said &#8220;<span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">Skirt</span> beautiful&#8221; to me. Then she spoke in Korean to our main English contact about what she was trying to say. Teacher <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Jang</span> looked at me and said &#8220;You should dress.&#8221; he was trying to <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">reiterate</span> that the Nurse liked my skirt. It just came out wrong and was <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">particularly</span> funny because of my paranoia. Teacher <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">Jang</span> is taking come throat <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">meds</span> so we are <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">blaming</span> that. <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<p>
<div>Finally, as I walked from break central back up to the English village a crew of first graders ran up to me yelling &#8220;Teacher, Teacher!&#8221; We are used commotion in the hallways when we walk through but these kids proceeded to drag me to the backdoor of the school. I was then <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">presented</span> with a box. As the top of the box was lifted open I was greeted by a dead bird. Okay, fine. Kids are kids. I went to get the first grade teacher to figure out how to dispose of this little guy. She came, spoke with the kids and left. I figured she was <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23">going</span> to get a bag or something. i waited a few minuted and nothing happened. So, I peaked back around the corner to her desk and the First Grade teacher was back at her computer. I went back to the outside door of the school and saw the children had left with the box and were playing with the bird like a baby doll. </div>
<p>
<div>Like I said, 30 minutes of a day. </div>
<div>Now I need to go and cut out shapes for name tags. </div>
<div>Happy Friday!</div>
<div>K</div>

<p>[NOTE - this post should come before <a href="http://www.spicyfishy.com/2008/09/mountains-gramaphones-and-carnivals-oh.html">Mountains, Gramaphones, and Carnivals, OH MY!</a>  but, so no one misses it, we have posted it here.  Enjoy...]</p>
<p>Our time travel landed us about &#8220;2 hours&#8221; after we took off, and we basically lost a day of our life, either to the spinning or to the flight.  After the slightly scary car ride we arrived in Yang Yang (3 and half hours from Seoul &#8211; right after the 14 hour flight <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  at our &#8220;Resortel&#8221;.  We were greeted by some other students who are part of the &#8220;Talk&#8221; program &#8211; a new program similar to Epik for students still in college or recently graduated to teach afterschool classes around Gangwon-do (our province).  They are mostly Korean-Americans or Canadian.  Their energy and excitement was a sharp contrast to our confusion and exhaustion.   In our dazed and confused state we settled into our large condo/room.  The room was very large with only a bed and tv, a kitchen with a few dishes, and another completely empty room.  We ate a snack then went to sleep after being up for most of a day and half.  The Jet-lag (or the rock hard bed) kicked in at about 5:00am when both of us layed awake &#8211; waiting for the other to move.  Once realized, we hopped up and went out to the beach for a stroll in the Sea of Japan Sunrise.  It was cloudy, so we missed most of it, but the walk was nice and we got a better view of our temporary residence.  The water was nice and the beach too &#8211; although littered with shells from fireworks and beer bottles.  The picture above is an abandoned carnival ride outside our resortel.  Yang Yang is a tourist destination in Korea &#8211; although it doesn&#8217;t seem to be thriving anymore <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />    <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNTu74uZlI/AAAAAAAAAFM/buqH9A4VLZ0/s720/IMG_4148.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNTu74uZlI/AAAAAAAAAFM/buqH9A4VLZ0/s720/IMG_4148.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />We walked for a bit and came back in before breakfast and a free day.  We arrived earlier than most of the new teachers so we got a day to hang out with the other early-birds and explore the <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNUIIeZxlI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4YpZQ6zKCm0/s720/IMG_4159.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNUIIeZxlI/AAAAAAAAAGA/4YpZQ6zKCm0/s720/IMG_4159.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>area.  We walked up the hill at the end of the beach to an amazing centuries old buddhist temple. I knew when we came upon the first temple that this was going to be one of those years you never forget.  At that point also it finally hit me that I was in the most foreign place I had ever experienced.  Scary? &#8211; not really.  I had a few people I barely knew but already liked and of course Kate to make it all feel comfortable.  And of course the sweet old monks who spoke a few words of English and wanted our pictures <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Communication aside &#8211; people are people and I started to realize then how much that simple idea will help me adapt and feel at home here.  I don&#8217;t know how to try to predict anything here.. and that&#8217;s amazing. Anyways.. We had a great time at <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNWK0wSzmI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Hw9aAV_vDt4/s720/IMG_4205.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/spicyfishy/SMNWK0wSzmI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/Hw9aAV_vDt4/s720/IMG_4205.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>the Temple and got some great pictures. We rented bikes at the hotel and walked around the beach a bit.  All in all &#8211; a long but nice adapting day.  We met many new people as they arrived from their various homes or most recent travels.  People from all over the world &#8211;  The US, Canada, Britain, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and even Thailand.  The next few days were full of lectures and events aimed at helping us adapt to Korea and to teaching.  As many of us have never taught before this was very valuable, and even for those who have, the general overview and structure of the Korean Classroom was very valuable.  We learned fantastic bits of wisdom that have and will help us to be accepted in our schools and respected for our work.  Oh and to make sure the kids actually learn something <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />    Every day felt like a week, and we were always exhausted in bed by 10 or 10:30 but it was a great way to ease into it all.  I&#8217;ll post more information on exactly what our job is and whom we work for (EPIK) in a later post.  This orientation was provided by EPIK for a week before we moved to our respective cities.  It felt like summer camp with our friends most days &#8211; as we were sheltered from real Korean life for the most part <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   I can&#8217;t say I was upset by that though.   It was a great week&#8230; <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br />Our last full day of orientation in Yang Yang was a full one filled with Korean culture. . . mostly.  The day began with a bus trip to Mount <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Sorak</span>, one of the most beautiful mountains in the northern part of South Korea.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiY8JdgMI/AAAAAAAAAdo/vIx0i7rmZDc/s1600-h/IMG_4237.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiY8JdgMI/AAAAAAAAAdo/vIx0i7rmZDc/s320/IMG_4237.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243635153000825026" border="0" /></a><br />We were hoping for a little more of a hike than we got.  Koreans love to hike  but all of their trails are paved and there are restaurants every few steps.  Not true for all mountains but I know its not that far off.  Despite the paved path, it was absolutely beautiful and we hope to get back to get onto the not paved trails soon.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiSb51kzI/AAAAAAAAAdg/_ORxNElHIaw/s1600-h/IMG_4239.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiSb51kzI/AAAAAAAAAdg/_ORxNElHIaw/s320/IMG_4239.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243635041266144050" border="0" /></a><br />This is a huge Buddha statue before the trail heads.  Chad caught a few extra couples in this <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">sna</span>p shot.  We didn&#8217;t get their names to email it to them.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiLCkntYI/AAAAAAAAAdY/wmqIRKTL6lo/s1600-h/IMG_4266.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiLCkntYI/AAAAAAAAAdY/wmqIRKTL6lo/s320/IMG_4266.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243634914207184258" border="0" /></a><br />A nice view from our little hike.  There are supposedly some not so plush cabins we could rent if we wanted <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">to</span> get really crazy and do a two day hike.  We&#8217;ll see if we can squeeze that in before it gets to chilly.</p>
<p>Okay, Mt, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Sorak</span> was stop one of this adventure filled day.  We travelled back to our <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Resortel</span> (which like to pronounce &#8220;<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">resortle</span>&#8220;), had lunch, and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">boarded</span> the buses for our next stop, our Korean cultural experience. . . . the <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">GRAMOPHONE</span> MUSEUM!  How Korean can you get?!</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiDqDvt_I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/q6YvwvZPc9w/s1600-h/IMG_4278.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUiDqDvt_I/AAAAAAAAAdQ/q6YvwvZPc9w/s320/IMG_4278.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243634787367761906" border="0" /></a><br />The museum was <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">interesting</span>.  First we went into a screening room chalk full of speakers which Chad go talk about for days.  We watched some music videos on a large screen <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">tv</span> and listened to the speakers.</p>
<p>The museum was started from a Korean man&#8217;s collection of <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">gramophones</span>.  He <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">received</span> his first when he was 6 and I think he got up to multiple thousands in his collection.</p>
<p>Chad is pictured above with the first <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">iPod</span>!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhnxNEVtI/AAAAAAAAAdI/zs_9zRdtKZQ/s1600-h/IMG_4273.JPG"> </a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhfSOMetI/AAAAAAAAAdA/Rbv-p0DKGm0/s1600-h/IMG_4280.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhfSOMetI/AAAAAAAAAdA/Rbv-p0DKGm0/s320/IMG_4280.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243634162493848274" border="0" /></a><br />Blending in with the scene.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhV4BM2_I/AAAAAAAAAc4/RtxjMyNR0bU/s1600-h/IMG_4281.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhV4BM2_I/AAAAAAAAAc4/RtxjMyNR0bU/s320/IMG_4281.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243634000841202674" border="0" /></a><br />Checking the acoustics.</p>
<p>After the museum we headed back to the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">Resortel</span> for dinner.  After dinner we saw a traditional Korean mask performance which was interesting.  We <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">wern&#8217;t</span> ready to go to bed so Chad and I headed to downtown Yang Yang (tiny).  We <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">bumped</span> into a couple of friends and stumbled upon and almost deserted carnival.</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhNiW8Y6I/AAAAAAAAAcw/KTAGb3ORZTU/s1600-h/IMG_4291.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUhNiW8Y6I/AAAAAAAAAcw/KTAGb3ORZTU/s320/IMG_4291.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243633857587864482" border="0" /></a><br />This lovely young woman pictured with me bargained with her friend so that I could play the dart game for a discounted price.  I hit some balloons which means I got a pink rubber ducky like toy!</p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUg_DBOUNI/AAAAAAAAAco/jYtK8VxqGFo/s1600-h/IMG_4292.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FHdJMBeKWmM/SMUg_DBOUNI/AAAAAAAAAco/jYtK8VxqGFo/s320/IMG_4292.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243633608657096914" border="0" /></a><br />Our friend Alex (far left) played another game and won.  His prize was a furry pink pillow with &#8220;I love you&#8221; written on it.  Also with us in the picture between Alex and Chad is our friend <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">Hai</span>.  <img src="http://www.spicyfishy.com/spicyfishy/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
