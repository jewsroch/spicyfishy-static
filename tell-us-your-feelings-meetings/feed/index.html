		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Chad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I like Kate&#039;s attitude. I think that&#039;s right -- if we can get the kids excited about English and life outside of Korea, we&#039;re halfway there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I think you&#039;re right that the only way this is going to work is if they let us take the reigns a little bit. It&#039;s kind of funny, isn&#039;t it... that for the students to learn the global language (and global culture that comes with it), the administrators and teachers will have to let go of doing it their Confucian, Korean way. It will happen eventually. We&#039;re breaking trail up here in Gangwondo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you are very lucky with your school. Enjoy it!]]></description>
