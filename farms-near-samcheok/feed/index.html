		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&#039;#comment-685&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Bill and Willa&lt;/a&gt; - Thanks Grandma!  We might try it sometime but I don&#039;t think we can get All Spice here.  We&#039;ll see.  Might just try to make some Applesauce instead.  Haven&#039;t seen that over here.  We do have an oven though.  It&#039;s really small but it can cook two small loaves of bread :)  
Thanks again,
Chad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chad and Kate,
Here is the apple butter recipe I use. If you want to, you can start with a quart of applesauce and add 1 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of all spice and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves.  Then you put it in a baking dish (9x 13 x 2) glass or metal if you don&#039;t have a glass baking dish.  Put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours. Stir it a couple of times while cooking.  If you do not have an oven then cook it down in a pan on top of the stove but it will burn easily so watch it. Do not let it get too thick.
We put it in jars while hot and seal so we can save it for winter eating. 
 If that isn&#039;t possible maybe Ma Brown has some on the shelf at the grocery store.....ha. 
We just decided yesterday to go to Carrollton Georgia for Thanksgiving. 
Thanks for the farm info.
Just watched the Ireland, Scotland, London trip again last night.  Such fun.
Love, Grandma]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;a href=&#039;#comment-673&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@Bill and Willa&lt;/a&gt; - They do raise a fair amount of corn, but it&#039;s a different kind.   It&#039;s kind of rubbery and more chewy - not as sweet either.  They raise lots of Rice, sweet potatoes, red spicy peppers and various fruits.  Near our school they grow a lot of strawberries in the winter (greenhouses).  It&#039;s interesting - their farming is much more hands on, tending to every plant and area of the fields.  Granted their fields are all on hills and in valleys so they&#039;re much smaller, but they&#039;re everywhere.. Pretty interesting.

		<description><![CDATA[We drove to Peoria today and there are not very many fields harvested yet here in IL.  Going to Jacksonville on Tuesday we saw some fields where the beans and corn where out and even some that had been plowed.  Do they raise much corn there.??
Happy fall. 
Love Grandma]]></description>
