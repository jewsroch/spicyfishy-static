		<description><![CDATA[What?  You&#039;re ready to come back home? Hm, I was under the impression that sitting at the computer doing cross word puzzles all day was fun... guess I should get out more. Anyway, I&#039;m up late... looking through my feeds, thought I would post -- I use dreamhost for hosting, they&#039;re fab I&#039;ve been with them for about 9 years now...cheap, easy web panel.. and they have one click wordpress installations, super simple... not much of a learning curve -- I just finished a wordpress install on my new site that&#039;s still quite buggy(flash contact/php is kicking my butt among other things) offsideher.com  --&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should give them a look -- I&#039;m also playing with flickr, you can see my flickr slideshow set implemented on this site too -- not sure if I like it, but it&#039;s easier than managing your own photos, you can batch, process, tag and upload with their little app -- I&#039;ll be installing my own flash photo gallery for swf movies, in the not so distant future-- and lightwindow has a neat photo gallery feature too, that I haven&#039;t used but it looks cool,  the drawback is still having to manage the galleries, with thumbnails and what not -- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, good luck, have a nice holiday and good vacation -- hey, I hear Chinese New Year is pretty cool around those parts... enjoy!]]></description>
